## jeff face looking dumb

My first UserConf was in New York this past May. One of the things I was most
struck by was that everyone I met was a practitioner - meaning they were
actually working in support, or community, or customer experience.

That makes me really nervous and excited to talk to you today, since you are
all so smart and experienced. So here goes nothing.

Today I want to talk about growth.

As support people, I don't think we talk about growth enough, and I think that
is because it can be a bit of a sticky situation.

On one hand, customer growth is exciting! More new people are using our tools
and talking about our company, and your mom might start to recognize what you
are working on.

On the other hand, it also means more inquiries, support tickets, and requests
for "just 5 minutes" of our time.

## Young Wistia

At Wistia, we went through our first growth experience in early 2012. We had
released this new set of features, and for the first time our vision was really
coming through in the product. We were breaking down barriers for lots of
potential customers we never had a shot with before.

So with more people interacting with our product and marketing, the support
volume started to increase.

Now at first it was just a small uptick, a few extra emails here or there.
Nothing to really be too concerned about.

But then the uptick turned into a sharp spike, and the spike turned into a
deluge.

The phones were ringing off the hook. The support inbox was turning over 3 or 4
times a day. It was just a constant stream of questions, suggestions, and
inquiries. I was drowning in support.

Many of you have probably experienced the feelings I was having. I was burned
out, exhausted, and generally sick of answering the same questions over and
over again.

## How to scale support?

So something had to change. When we were thinking about how we could scale
support, we boiled it down to three options.

## 3 Options (Money, Broken Phone, NEW WAY)

First, we could build a support army.

We could raise a bunch of money, hire a whole ton of folks, and stick them in a
call center or closet to answer emails and phone calls. They would probably
hate their jobs, stick around for a year or so, and then leave. At some point,
we might stop getting to know them, since there are so many of them and they
don't stay long.

While it would be awesome to have the resources to get customers fast
responses, this would a cultural nightmare and a really tough route to make
work. None of us wanted to work at a company with a call center, and I really
didn't want to manage one.

Second, we could just make it impossible for any customers to contact us.

We could remove all of our phone numbers, close down support email addresses, and
just go dark. We could probably get by like that for a while, and even make our
product cheaper, since we wouldn't need to hire support people.

Our product would probably become a power users dream - only useful to really
experienced users. The only problem is, there wouldn't be any power users to
enjoy it.

So those two options seemed pretty terrible. We needed a third option. A
mythical hybrid creature. A NEW WAY.

## Show me the new way

We would somehow meld the best parts of options 1 and 2 together.

We would somehow increase the number of customers that could communicate with us
at once AND present them support options BESIDES our contact info.

I've been working on this NEW WAY for a few years now, but I've been
kinda struggling on a name for it until recently. To properly introduce it,
however, I am going to need to beat the heck out of a metaphor.

## Ronny Coleman is really strong

Does anyone know who this is?

This is Ronny Coleman. Ronny is an American powerlifter who has won Mr. Olympia
EIGHT TIMES.

Ronny is also a really funny guy. His self-inspirational quips and quotes get
yelled out quite a bit.

## PLAY RONNY COLEMAN VIDEO

## "LIGHT WEIGHT BABY!"

So if you want to get strong like Ronny, you have two options. You could lift
light weights a bazillion times...or you could lift really freaking heavy
weights a few times.

Successful powerlifters like Ronny subscribe to the idea of heavier weights,
fewer lifts.

## “Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support”

How many people here send a lot of email? (HANDS OR CLAPS)

So we pretty much all do. The average support response we send is probably
pretty easy, something we've sent hundreds of times.

Support emails you can write in your sleep is like Ronny curling a 20 pound
dumbbell - it's a light weight!

Again and again, you're lifting these light weights, and you gotta lift them
all day in order to get the value. So that is a heavy rep, light weight
approach. It's exhausting, it uses up all your time, and it's not terribly
helpful to our customers, either.

It’s time to start approaching your job more like Ronny. I'm here to introduce you
to the Heavy Ass Weights of Support.

The heavy ass weights are useful resources that customers can refer to again
and again. They help you scale your message and reach more customers
efficiently.

## Heavy Weight Examples

So what the heck are the Heavy Ass Weights of support?

Well they are resources you are probably all familiar with, like documentation, 
in-app help, webinars, and screencasts.

Listen, you probably all know about these things - the challenge is finding the
time to do them well. My job is to convince you to do the work upfront,
rather than the light-weight equivalent, because these resources pay huge,
scalable dividends over time for both you and your customers.

## Heavy Ass Weight Key benefits

So the first part of my talk today is to highlight the big benefits of the
heavy ass weight approach. I'm looking to inspire you to find one piece of your
product or service that could be better documented, or find one piece of
documentation that is thorough but has the wrong voice, and fix it up.

The second part of my talk will be some of my tips for creating excellent
support resources.

The heavy ass weight approach creates badass users, helps us connect with them
at scale, and also helps us build incredibly talented teams.

So let's get started with creating badass users.

## Heavy Ass Weights => Badass Users

The first benefit is that Heavy Weight support resources create what Kathy
Sierra calls "badass users".

If you haven't seen Kathy's talk on Building the Minimum Badass User from
Business of Software 2012, go check it out after this.

(add extra pause)

As support folks, our end goal is to create badass users. Through all the email
we send, we are trying to educate them to do great things with our apps.

Badass users know how to get shit done using your app, and are confident in
doing so.  They are your strongest advocates, because they see the benefits of
using your product and do so on a frequent basis.

## The Heavy Ass Weights are Empowering

So how do the heavy ass weights create more badass users?

In short, it is because the heavy ass weight approach is more empowering.

Let's say a customer wants to do something, so in my world it might be customizing a video, and
they don't know where to start. Maybe it's been a while since they last accessed their
account.

If we are coming at this from the light weight approach, the confused user has
to drop an email to support, or call a help line, in order to move forward.
They might even have their own account rep, who is there to answer their every
question.

So every time they want to try something new, they have to call
you. Or email you. Or tweet at you. Customers become frozen with fear about
moving forward on their own.

The heavy weight approach means helping the user find a useful resource by searching your documentation or an in-app tool tip
that gets them through the action.

With a well-designed resource they can use again and again, they *get it*. They
weren't led by the hand by an account rep - they learned it on their own. This
leads to more exploration, more courage, and ultimately more doing.

## Takeaway 1

To wrap up this point: Heavy ass weight support enables your users to
accomplish their task, again and
again, on their timetable - no more waiting for you and your email response.



## HAW create personal connection

So the first big benefit is Heavy Ass Weights create Badass users.

The second big benefit is going to be a bit counterintuitive. Heavy Ass weights
actually create a personal connection between your team and brand and the user.

Lots of folks who are considering using a more self-service approach tell me
they are scared of losing contact with their customers and lose the personal
connection they used to have.

I'm here to tell you nothing could be further from the truth.

## We are not automatons

Our support inboxes still receive lots of communication every day from our
customers - its just more focused on more advanced actions and technical
troubleshooting.

The robots are not going to take over support anytime soon. It's still really
valuable to be able to connect with customers and talk about their problems.

But the way we talk with them has changed. Because they watch our videos and
read our documentation first, they've gotten to know us.

They get to know our product and personality through our videos and other
support resources, and it creates a personal and emotional connection.

Instead of relying on the support person's mood or whim to make the strong
connection in the first few emails, we lead with consistently bright, cheery,
and helpful videos and documentation. No back and forth required.

## email images

This also creates this neat side benefit of lovely emails. We get lots of
emails that lead with "First, we love Wistia", and then dive into the core of
their technical issue.

This makes support a lot more fun to tackle (it's amazing, and we're hiring -
come find me later).

## Takeaway 3

If your heavy weight support resources are crafted in your own voice and
reflecting your brand personality, using them is actually the best way to scale
your brand voice.


## Big Slide of Progress

I guess the third benefit is the most obvious. Some of you might have seen this
in your email.

Because we are lifting the heavy ass weights, we aren't slammed with the volume
of support that a light-weight practitioner is. Our goal is to provide
resources for everything, so that those who want self-service can do so. We'll
still be here for technical discussions and for chatting about espresso.

The top line is our new user growth, and the bottom line is our total support
requests. Early on we were increasing total support volume by a number about
equal to our new customers, meaning for each new user we'd have another email
that month.

Today, our monthly support volume is less than 1% of our total user base.

So this is the what it looks like when you are lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of
support.

When you are on-boarding happy customers who don't require a lot of high-touch,
you get a graph that looks like this. And you are happy.

What's really crazy here is our percentage churn, which has not only stayed
low, but actually decreased over this time.


## video SEO function in the Product

So now I want to tell you a quick story about using the heavy ass weights in
our support process.

At Wistia, our Video SEO feature is one of the big differentiators for us and
we draw lots of new customers because of it.

Now that’s awesome, but it’s also one of our most confusing features, because
it requires the user to do a bunch of work and there are several moving parts
involved.

At one point, we were receiving ten to twenty emails a day with folks who were
confused by the Video SEO feature, or had missed a step and now it wasn’t
working.

I'm sure I don't have to tell this crowd - when your product isn't working as
the customer expects, it's a very serious problem.

## Video in sidebar

Over coffee one morning, Chris and I decided to shoot a video outlining the
required Video SEO feature steps.

We based the script on the emails we were already sending, so it didn't take
that long to whip it together. Maybe an hour to script, setup, and shoot.

When it was ready, we added it to the Video SEO tool page inside customer
accounts with a post-roll call-to-action to read more in our documentation.

## Video itself

Here is the video (insert video?)

## Stats for Video SEO

Overnight, those emails disappeared. I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I say
they went to zero.

This is what the stats looked like for that video after a few weeks. It was
definitely getting some watches - and almost 30 hours of video were watched.

That's 30 hours of help and hand-holding we didn't have to provide.

## pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K

So this brings up the question of what our team actually does.

The inbox is only the beginning.

Because our inbox and phone call volume is no longer directly tied to customer
growth, we haven’t had to hire a whole bunch of recent college grads, chain
them to a desk, and flood them with customer calls every day.

Instead, I’m able to hire a few really smart, really talented people who
improve our customer’s lives in so many ways.

Max and Jordan, for example, run a weekly web show where they welcome Wistia
newbies into the fray. The whole thing is improv, so they get to talking heavy
metal and whiskey with our new customers more than you'd think.

The light-weight approach is lots of 1 on 1 demos. Max and Jordan handle
questions in bulk - which is a great way to provide folks who need a little
extra hand-holding a great experience without it being a total time suck.

Mercer is always working with the development team to identify fixes for deep
technical problems, which delight our long-time customers.

Contrast that with the light-weight approach, which is issuing bug reports and
creating that strained, back-and-forth relationship between support and
development teams.

With a focus on scalable resources, there is no limit to the type of things you
can build for your customers. They will thank you (with their money) for
considering their time and helping them achieve their goals.

## Takeaway 4

You will not automate away people by adopting a heavy ass weight approach.
Instead, you will give them the headroom and the freedom to make amazing things
and give your customers superpowers.

## MAKE IT F'ing AWESOME

At Wistia, one of our core values is “make it fucking awesome”. I like to think
we’ve stayed true to that with our versions of the heavy ass weights.

For the rest of my time I want to talk about the Heavy Ass weights our team has
created, and give you some tactical suggestions for making yours awesome.

## Screenshot of Wistia Documentation

The first is documentation. Pretty much everyone in the room has documentation,
right? If you are a b2b app, you need documentation.

**How do you use it?**

Include a link to it in your emails, to train your customers to start looking
in the docs. Place the link to it prominently in your app, so users looking to
self-service can find it without trouble.

**How do you make it awesome?**

Keep it simple, use lots of pictures, and make the language friendly. Think
about who ends up in the documentation - lost folks who might be frustrated.
Set good context and help them!!

Next, of course, is video. This one is a little less common, although
screencasting software has made the dreaded slow walkthrough of death more
popular. So I thought I'd sell you a bit more on creating video as part of your
support.

FIRST: video takes the personal touch you've been providing via support for
years, and scales it up. Awesome. We use lots of real-people faces to build a
connection with those interested in support.

SECOND: video takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users
with plenty of energy to GO DO the thing they came to do. Ever read a huge
block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? OK that's
what we want to avoid.

Finally, video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support.
Reading documentation outside of your product is totally confusing and useless.
Having big blocks of text inside your interface is a good way to encourage
folks NOT to use your app. Video bridges that gap. You should make it.

**How do you use video?**

Include links to it in your support emails. Have a place for it to live (ours
lives in our documentation) and make it a first-class option for your new
users.  Remember, no one woke up this morning and wants to become an expert at
your app.  Video seems like a low-investment option for them to figure out what
they want to do.

**How do you make it awesome?**

Keep it nice and short. No one likes a super long and boring walkthrough. No
one.  Second, get your face on there! Make it personal - people love that
personal connection.

The final Heavy Ass Weight I want to cover here is our Web Show.

A few years ago, one of our big drains was *demo time*. Who here does demos?
(hands) Yeah they aren't the most fun thing in the world, totally light
weights.  They cover a lot of the same stuff over and again. Whenever you spot
that - good time to find something more efficient.

Our Customer Champions Max and Jordan took on the concept of a weekly Web Show
for our newest users. Attendees get a quick walkthrough the major flows in our
app, and then they get some higher-level tips on using video marketing
effectively.

For me, the most important part of their web show is that it's FUN! They crack
a lot of jokes, take any and all questions live, and encourage lots of
participation. Instead of a dreaded hour of boring walkthrough of our app, it's
transformed into something that puts a smile on our customer's faces. They take
that away and go get stuff done in their accounts. It's awesome.

## Reminder: Your Time is Valuable

I want to close with a little bit more about you. And your time.

The **hero** support person is well known. They are awesome - spending endless
hours communicating with customers, walking them through the product,
communicating their requests to the product team, issuing bugs on their behalf.

We all love and respect the support hero. But here's what happens - that person
has all the front-line feedback and communications in their head, and no time
to get deep on sharing it.

The support hero doesn't have time to participate in new product walkthroughs,
or provide thoughtful feedback on new feature iterations. As a result, the
product goes out absent of context - it may solve customer problems, but
perhaps not in the way they'd like to use it. That creates more support, which
further buries our hero. It's a crappy, never ending cycle and no one wins!

I beg of you, if you only take one thing away from this talk: your time is
important. When you see something that is draining your time and preventing you
from doing next level work for your customers, find a way to automate it away.
Don't be afraid that just because you aren't personally interfacing with your
customer's, they will be angry with you. For most, that personal touch was
never important in the first place. All they need are clear, helpful support
resources.

Make more happy customers. Lift some heavy ass weights. Thank you.

We don't create support resources for power users - we *teach* users how to
become power users.

## Customers want to do things!

No one got up this morning and said "I'm going to be excellent at an app!" They
certainly didn't say that my product, Wistia.

Instead, they have something they want to accomplish, and our goal as
customer-focused people is to get them there, as quickly and easily as
possible.

When it comes to those early, repeated tasks - what we might call the
onboarding tasks - getting them the help they need quickly means getting the
heck out of the way.

// frame this better //

## Screenshot of Doc Greatest Hits

So for Wistia (we're a video hosting and analytics platform), that means
Upload, Customize, Embed, and Checking Stats.

Oh look at that, we've got a Greatest Hits doc page with those actions.

## Screenshot of Wistia Basics Page

In fact, we've got a whole Wistia Basics series that covers those actions.

## Takeaway 2

Users will feel most empowered when they can accomplish the tasks that prove
the value of your product on their own. Empowered users are also most likely to
reach for their wallets.

(Yes, this means an intuitive product, but that is a topic for a different
talk.)

For us, that means making sure we've got those onboarding steps well documented
and covered in multiple media. I'll cover in a bit more detail how we can do
that in a bit.
