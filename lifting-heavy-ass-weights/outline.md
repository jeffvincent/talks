## jeff face looking dumb

My first UserConf was in New York this past May. One of the things I was most
struck by was that everyone I met was a practitioner - they were actually
working in support, or community, or customer experience. That makes me really
nervous and excited to talk to you today, since you are all so smart and
experienced. So here goes nothing.

## How to scale support?

Today I want to talk about growing.

As support people, growth can be a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand,
customer growth is exciting! More new people are using our tools and talking
about our company. On the other hand, it means more inquiries, support tickets,
and requests for "5 minutes" of our time.

In early 2012, we launched at Wistia a new set of features, and the customer
uptake was really strong. We went from a slow trickle of support to a monsoon.

To scale support alongside growth, you've got three basic options:

## 3 Options (Money, Broken Phone, NEW WAY)

We could raise a bunch of money and hire lots of new folks to answer emails.

We could make it really hard for new users to contact us.

Or, we could somehow increase the number of customers that can communicate with us
at once. We could create scalable, useful resources that customers can refer to
again and again.

Listen: the first two are totally legit approaches - I see companies that use
them to great effect. But the only one that *really feels* right to me is
number three, using static support resources to scale your support presence.

I'm going to spend my time talking about number three, and to properly do that,
I am going to beat the heck out of a metaphor.

## Ronny Coleman is really strong

Does anyone know who this is?

This is Ronny Coleman. Ronny is an American powerlifter who has won Mr. Olympia
EIGHT TIMES.

Ronny is also a really funny guy. His self-inspirational quips and quotes
get yelled out quite a bit.

** PLAY RONNY COLEMAN SOUND EFFECT **

## Illustrate Options

So if you want to get strong like Ronny, you have two options. You could lift
light weights a bazillion times...or you could lift really freaking heavy
weights a few times.

Successful powerlifters like Ronny subscribe to the idea of heavier
weights, fewer lifts.

## "LIGHT WEIGHT BABY!"

How many people here send a lot of email? (HANDS)

So we pretty much all do. The average support response we send is probably
pretty easy, something we've sent hundreds of times.

Support emails you can write in your sleep is like Ronny curling a 20 pound
dumbbell - it's a light weight!

Again and again, you're lifting these light weights, and you gotta lift them all
day in order to get the value. So that is a heavy rep, light weight approach.

## “Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support”

It’s time to start approaching your job like Ronny. I'm here to introduce you
to the Heavy Ass Weights of Support.

So what are heavy weights of support?

Heavy weight support is resources like documentation, in-app help, and screencasts.
They take a lot of work upfront, but pay huge, scalable dividends over time for
you and your customers.

First I'm going to talk through what I see as the key benefits for using this
heavy weight approach, and then we'll talk about some of the tactical stuff we
do to make them great.

## Heavy Ass Weights => Badass Users

The first benefit is that Heavy Weight support resources create what Kathy
Sierra calls "badass users".

If you haven't seen Kathy's talk on Building the Minimum Badass User from
Business of Software 2012, go check it out after this.

In the talk, Kathy lays out the definition of *expert*:

## Given a Representative Task, experts perform in a superior way, more reliably than experienced non-experts.

(read definition)

There are two pieces of this. The first part is our users experience friction
every time they want to use our app and don't know how.

## Friction Slide

They want to do something, in my world it might be customizing a video, and
they don't know where to start. Maybe it's been a bit since they accessed their
account.

If we are coming at this from the light weight approach, the confused user has
to drop an email to support, or call a help line, in order to move forward.

If, on the other hand, we are using the heavy weight approach, the user might
find a useful resource by searching your documentation or an in-app tool tip
that gets them through the action. If this is an action they will be performing
often, they might watch your screencast a few times, or bookmark the
documentation page for future reference.

## Takeaway 1

This is the first part of creating badass users using the heavy weights: Heavy
ass weight support enables your users to accomplish their task, again and
again, on their timetable - no more waiting for you and your email response.

## Heavy Ass Weights are empowering

The second piece of creating badass users using the heavy ass weights is about
empowerment.

As a customer, sending an email to support and waiting for a response makes them
more dependent on you. Every time they want to try something new, they feel like
they have to call you. Or email you. Or tweet at you. Customers are frozen with
fear about moving forward on their own.

No one got up this morning and said "I'm going to be excellent at an app!" They
certainly didn't say that my product, Wistia.

Instead, they have something they want to accomplish, and our goal as customer-focused
people is to get them there, as quickly and easily as possible.

When it comes to those early, repeated tasks - what we might call the
onboarding tasks - getting them the help they need quickly means getting the
heck out of the way.

## Screenshot of Doc Greatest Hits

So for Wistia (we're a video hosting and analytics platform),
that means Upload, Customize, Embed, and Checking Stats.

Oh look at that, we've got a Greatest Hits doc page with those actions.

## Screenshot of Wistia Basics Page

In fact, we've got a whole Wistia Basics series that covers those actions.

## Takeaway 2

Users will feel most empowered when they can accomplish the tasks that prove
the value of your product on their own.

(Yes, this means an intuitive product, but that is a topic for a different talk.)

For us, that means making sure we've got those onboarding steps well documented
and covered in multiple media. I'll cover in a bit more detail how we can do
that in a bit.

## HAW create personal connection

So the first big benefit is Heavy Ass Weights create Badass users.

The second big benefit is going to be a bit counterintuitive. Heavy Ass weights
actually create a personal connection between your team and brand and the user.

When I talk about automation, lots of folks tell me they are scared of losing
contact with their customers and lose the personal connection they used to have.

I'm here to tell you nothing could be further from the truth.

## Takeaway 3

If your heavy weight support resources are crafted in your own voice and
reflecting your brand personality, using them is actually the best way to scale
your brand voice.

Our support inboxes still receive lots of communication every day from our
customers - its just more focused on more advanced actions and technical troubleshooting.

Because they watch our videos and read our documentation first, they've gotten
to know us. They get to know our product and personality through our videos and
other support resources, and it creates a personal and emotional connection.

Instead of relying on the support person's mood or whim to make the strong
connection in the first few emails, we lead with consistently bright, cheery,
and helpful videos and documentation. No back and forth required.

## email image?

This also creates this neat side benefit of lovely emails. We get lots of
emails that lead with "First, we love Wistia", and then dive into the core of
their technical issue.

This makes support a lot more fun to tackle (it's amazing, and we're hiring - come find me later).



## Big Slide of Progress

I guess the third benefit is the most obvious. Some of you might have seen this
in your email.

Because we are lifting the heavy ass weights, we aren't slammed with the volume
of support that a light-weight practitioner is. Our goal is to provide
resources for everything, so that those who want self-service can do so. We'll
still be here for technical discussions and for chatting about espresso.

The top line is our new user growth, and the bottom line is our total support
requests. Early on we were increasing total support volume by a number about
equal to our new customers, meaning for each new user we'd have another
email that month.

Today, our monthly support volume is less than 1% of our total user base.

So this is the what it looks like when you are lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of support.

When you are on-boarding happy customers who don't require a lot of high-touch,
you get a graph that looks like this. And you are happy.

What I also wish I could show is our percentage churn, which has not only
stayed low, but actually decreased over this time.

We don't create support resources for power users - we *teach* users how to
become power users.

## video SEO function in the Product

I want to tell you a quick story about our product and support.

At Wistia, our Video SEO feature is one of the big differentiators for us and we
draw lots of new customers because of it.

Now that’s awesome, but it’s also one of our most confusing features, because
it requires the user to do a bunch of work and there are several moving parts
involved.

At one point, we were receiving ten to twenty emails a day with folks who were
confused by the Video SEO feature, or had missed a step and now it wasn’t
working.

I'm sure I don't have to tell this crowd - when your product isn't working as
the customer expects, it's a very serious problem.

## Video in sidebar

So in about 20 minutes, Chris and I shot a video outlining the required Video SEO
feature steps.

The script was based on the emails we were already sending, so it didn't take
that long to whip it together.

When it was ready, we added it to the Video SEO tool page inside customer accounts
with a post-roll call-to-action to read more in our documentation.

Overnight, those emails disappeared. I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I
say they went to zero.

## Stats for Video SEO

This is what the stats looked like for that video after a few weeks. It was
definitely getting some watches - and almost 30 hours of video were watched.

That's 30 hours of help and hand-holding we didn't have to provide.


---



## we are not automatons

The second question I get is some riff on "are you trying to automate away all
your support? Will the robots take over support at Wistia?" Our job is not to
automate away all support conversations - we're realistic to
know that isn't possible, and it is really valuable to be able to connect with
customers around their problems.

But what we do strive for is creating the smoothest path from first touch to
experiencing the **core value** of the product. Your goal should be for your
heavy weights to cover all the basic workflows of your
product - enough to get your users to discover the value and then reach for
their wallets.

## pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K

The third question I get is about our team. After I talk about my vision for
support, I occasionally have applicants ask me if their job is safe, if I
really want to automate away more and more conversations.

For those who get it, you know. The inbox is only the beginning.

Because our inbox and phone call volume is no longer directly tied to customer
growth, we haven’t had to hire a whole bunch of recent college grads, chain them
to a desk, and flood them with customer calls every day. Instead, I’m able to
hire a few really smart, really talented people who improve our customer’s lives
in so many ways.

Max and Jordan, for example, run a weekly web show where they welcome Wistia
newbies into the fray. The whole thing is improv, so they get to talking heavy
metal and whiskey with our new customers more than you'd think. They always
come out of the show laughing with really raving reviews. Contrast that to your 
average 1 on 1 demos, and it's a great way to provide folks who need a little
extra hand-holding a great experience without it being a time suck.

Mercer is always working with the development team to identify fixes for deep
technical problems, which delight our long-time customers. Contrast that with
your typical bug reports and strained relationship between support and
development.

With a focus on scalable resources, there is no limit to the type of things you
can build for your customers. They will thank you (with their money) for
considering their time and helping them achieve their goals.

In short, lifting heavy ass weights allows you to build a support experience
your customers have probably never had before.

## Peter and Jackie Monticup

I figured no presentation on users would be complete without a living,
breathing user, so I'd like to introduce you to one of my favorite
customers, Jackie Monticup. Jackie and her husband Peter run MagicTricks.com -
it's exactly what it sounds like, a magic tricks ecommerce site. Which is
awesome.

Jackie and Peter spend their days shooting new magic trick promo videos,
communicating with their customers, and shipping out tricks for their excited
magician clientele.

When Jackie started using Wistia, she didn’t have much experience with using web
apps OR web video. She also couldn’t spend a ton of time waiting for us to get
back to her with a support response.

Jackie is what Jeff Lawson from Twilio calls a **DOER**. She is not interested
in being sold to, or having her hand held. She has a mission and she wants to
get it done.

## Wistia Basics page

When she started overhauling the MagicTricks.com website and adding Wistia
embedded videos, she turned to our Wistia Basics video series for help.

She was able to learn the ins-and-outs of customization and embedding, and I’m
now proud to call her an expert. She is a happy customer who feels comfortable
and empowered to get her work done.

When she needs it, Jackie knows how to find our help docs and help videos. It
makes her happy using our product, which makes me happy.



## MAKE IT FUCKING AWESOME

At Wistia, one of our core values is “make it fucking awesome”. I like to think
we’ve stayed true to that with our versions of the heavy ass weights.

For the rest of my time I want to talk about the Heavy Ass weights our team has
created, and give you some tactical suggestions for making yours awesome.

## Screenshot of Wistia Documentation

The first is documentation. Pretty much everyone in the room has documentation,
right? If you are a b2b app, you need documentation.

**How do you use it?**

Include a link to it in your emails, to train your customers to start looking
in the docs. Place the link to it prominently in your app, so users looking to
self-service can find it without trouble.

**How do you make it awesome?**

Keep it simple, use lots of pictures, and make the language friendly. Think
about who ends up in the documentation - lost folks who might be frustrated.
Set good context and help them!!

Next, of course, is video. This one is a little less common, although
screencasting software has made the dreaded slow walkthrough of death more
popular. So I thought I'd sell you a bit more on creating video as part of your
support.

FIRST: video takes the personal touch you've been providing via support for
years, and scales it up. Awesome. We use lots of real-people faces to build a
connection with those interested in support.

SECOND: video takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users
with plenty of energy to GO DO the thing they came to do. Ever read a huge
block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? OK that's
what we want to avoid.

Finally, video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support.
Reading documentation outside of your product is totally confusing and useless.
Having big blocks of text inside your interface is a good way to encourage
folks NOT to use your app. Video bridges that gap. You should make it.

**How do you use video?**

Include links to it in your support emails. Have a place for it to live (ours
lives in our documentation) and make it a first-class option for your new
users.  Remember, no one woke up this morning and wants to become an expert at
your app.  Video seems like a low-investment option for them to figure out what
they want to do.

**How do you make it awesome?**

Keep it nice and short. No one likes a super long and boring walkthrough. No
one.  Second, get your face on there! Make it personal - people love that
personal connection.

The final Heavy Ass Weight I want to cover here is our Web Show.

A few years ago, one of our big drains was *demo time*. Who here does demos?
(hands) Yeah they aren't the most fun thing in the world, totally light
weights.  They cover a lot of the same stuff over and again. Whenever you spot
that - good time to find something more efficient.

Our Customer Champions Max and Jordan took on the concept of a weekly Web Show
for our newest users. Attendees get a quick walkthrough the major flows in our
app, and then they get some higher-level tips on using video marketing
effectively.

For me, the most important part of their web show is that it's FUN! They crack
a lot of jokes, take any and all questions live, and encourage lots of
participation. Instead of a dreaded hour of boring walkthrough of our app, it's
transformed into something that puts a smile on our customer's faces. They take
that away and go get stuff done in their accounts. It's awesome.

## Reminder: Your Time is Valuable

I want to close with a little bit more about you. And your time.

The **hero** support person is well known. They are awesome - spending endless
hours communicating with customers, walking them through the product,
communicating their requests to the product team, issuing bugs on their behalf.

We all love and respect the support hero. But here's what happens - that person
has all the front-line feedback and communications in their head, and no time
to get deep on sharing it.

The support hero doesn't have time to participate in new product walkthroughs,
or provide thoughtful feedback on new feature iterations. As a result, the
product goes out absent of context - it may solve customer problems, but
perhaps not in the way they'd like to use it. That creates more support, which
further buries our hero. It's a crappy, never ending cycle and no one wins!

I beg of you, if you only take one thing away from this talk: your time is
important. When you see something that is draining your time and preventing you
from doing next level work for your customers, find a way to automate it away.
Don't be afraid that just because you aren't personally interfacing with your
customer's, they will be angry with you. For most, that personal touch was
never important in the first place. All they need are clear, helpful support
resources.

Make more happy customers. Lift some heavy ass weights. Thank you.
