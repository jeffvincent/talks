## jeff face looking dumb

My first UserConf was in New York this past May. One of the things I was most
struck by was that everyone I met was a practitioner - meaning they were
actually working in support, or community, or customer experience.

That makes me really nervous and excited to talk to you today, since you are
all so smart and experienced. So here goes nothing.

## Wistia Sign

My name is Jeff, I work at Wistia. We're a video hosting and analytics platform
for business. We also have cute dogs.

Today I want to talk about growth.

As support people, we don't talk about growth enough, and I think that is
because it can be a bit of a sticky situation.

On one hand, customer growth is exciting! More new people are using our tools
and talking about our company, and your mom might start to recognize what you
are working on.

On the other hand, it also means more inquiries, support tickets, and requests
for "just 5 minutes" of our time.

## Young Wistia

At Wistia, we went through our first growth experience in early 2012. We had
released this new set of features, and for the first time we were really
separating ourselves from the competition. We were breaking down barriers for
lots of potential customers we never had a shot with before.

At first, the support increase was just a small uptick, a few extra emails here
or there.  Nothing to really be concerned about.

## oh yeah, we did

But slowly the uptick turned into a full-on monsoon.

The phones were ringing off the hook. The support inbox was just a constant
stream of questions, suggestions, and inquiries. I was drowning in support.

Many of you have probably experienced what I was feeling at that time. I was
burned out, exhausted, and generally sick of answering the same questions over
and over again.

## How to scale support?

So something had to change. In figuring out how we could scale support, we
evaluated three basic options.

## 3 Options (Money, Broken Phone, NEW WAY)

First, we could build a support army.

We could raise a bunch of money, hire a whole ton of folks, and stick them in a
support closet to do nothing but answer emails and phone calls. They would
probably hate their jobs, stick around for a year or so, and then leave.

This would have been a cultural nightmare. So that one was out.

Second, we could just make it impossible for any customers to contact us.

We could remove all of our phone numbers, close down support email addresses,
and just go dark. We could probably get by like that for a while, and even make
our product cheaper, since we wouldn't need to hire support people.

But we love helping people! One of the true joys of my life at Wistia is being
able to problem solve for our customers.

So both of those two options seemed pretty terrible. We needed a third option.
A mythical hybrid creature.

We needed a NEW WAY.

## Show me the new way

We would somehow meld the best parts of options 1 and 2 together.

We would increase the number of customers that could communicate with us at
once AND present them self-service support options to reach for BESIDES our
contact info.

I've been working on this NEW WAY for a few years now, but I've been kinda
struggling on a name for it until recently. To properly introduce it, however,
I am going to need to beat the heck out of a metaphor.

## Ronny Coleman is really strong

Does anyone know who this is?

This is Ronny Coleman. Ronny is an American powerlifter who has won Mr. Olympia
EIGHT TIMES.

Ronny is also a really funny guy. His self-inspirational quips and quotes get
yelled out quite a bit.

## PLAY RONNY COLEMAN VIDEO

## "LIGHT WEIGHT BABY!"

So if you want to get strong like Ronny, you have two options. You could lift
light weights a bazillion times...or you could lift really freaking heavy
weights a few times.

Successful powerlifters like Ronny subscribe to the idea of heavier weights,
fewer lifts.

## Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support

How many people here send a lot of email? (HANDS OR CLAPS)

So we pretty much all do. The average support response we send is probably
pretty easy, something we've sent hundreds of times.

Support emails you can write in your sleep is like Ronny curling a 20 pound
dumbbell - it's a light weight!

Again and again, you're lifting these light weights, and you gotta lift them
all day in order to get the value. That is a light weight, heavy repetition
approach. It's exhausting, it uses up all your time, and it's not terribly
helpful to our customers, either.

Itâ€™s time to start viewing your job more like Ronny. It's time to start lifting
the Heavy Ass Weights of Support.

Heavy weight support is an approach - it is systematically looking at the those
support conversations we have again and again - those rough spots in our
customer's experience - and creating useful resources to help educate our
customers and get them going again.

## Heavy Weight Examples

Heavy weight resources are nothing new - they are things like documentation,
in-app help, webinars, and screencasts.

You know these things can help your customers - the challenge is prioritizing
them, and doing them well. Too often we decide to just keep answering
frequently asked questions, or just keep providing 1-on-1 demos.

My job is to convince you these deserve your time up front, because doing them
well pays huge dividends over time for you and your customers.

## Heavy Ass Weight Key benefits

So the first part of my talk today is to highlight the big benefits of this
approach. Then, the second part will be some of my tips for creating excellent
support resources.

So the big benefits: lifting heavy ass weights creates badass users, helps us
connect with them at scale, and also helps us build incredibly talented teams.

So let's get started with creating badass users.

## Heavy Ass Weights => Badass Users

I'm stealing a Kathy Sierra term on this one. When she said "badass", she was
using it as a synonym for "expert". Badass users (or experts) know how to get
shit done using your app, and are confident using it.

As support folks, our end goal has always been to create badass users. We are
educators and map builders, guiding our customers to creating awesome things.

## The Heavy Ass Weights are Empowering

The heavy weight approach creates more badass users faster because it is a more
empowering experience.

Let's say a customer wants to do something common, so in my world it might be
customizing a video, and they don't know where to start.

## Hand-holding support is not empowering

In the light weight approach, the confused user has to drop an email to
support, or call a help line, in order to move forward.  They might even have
their own account rep, who is there to answer their every question.

The thing is, our customers don't learn by being held by the hand. They learn
by tinkering, by understanding how the pieces fit together.

Customers get conditioned that when they want to try something new, they have
to call you. Or email you. Or tweet at you. Customers become frozen with fear
about trying something new.

## Train harder and grow bigger

With the heavy weight approach, we would identify customizing as an important
workflow to learn. We would make sure there was a prominent link to our
documentation for help, and a really well-thought out doc page clearly laying
out how to customize a video. To make it really easy, we might also add an
in-app tool tip that gets stuck users going again.

A well-designed, thorough resource means they learn it on their own. This leads
to more confidence, which leads to more exploration and ultimately more doing.

## Takeaway

To wrap up this point: Heavy weight support enables your users to accomplish
their task, again and again, on their timetable - no more waiting for you and
your email response.

## badass users want self-service help

So the first big benefit of the Heavy Ass Weights is they create Badass users.

Now that we've created all these badass users, how do we connect with them?

Badass users doesn't need hand-holding from an account rep, and they don't want
to sit on hold waiting for your support team.

Instead, they want helpful resources they can refer to again and again. What is
holding us back from adopting this approach?

The fear, I think, is that self-service support will lead to a disconnect with
our loving customers. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Ok (deep breath) I want you to repeat this mantra, preferably each night before
you go to bed:

## The Best Support is No Support

The best support is no support. It's ok for them not to actually speak to us in
the support inbox.

## the inbox is a terrible place to meet people.

Too often, the "connection" with our customers originates in the support inbox.

And the support context is a terrible place to meet people! The customer is
stressed, the support person has a queue out the door - it's a recipe for
disaster.

What if instead of waiting for them, we created resources that walked them
through the getting started workflows, and then started adding frequently asked
questions to those resources?

Suddenly our conversations go from being reactive, from having to reset
expectations and beg for forgiveness, to being valuable and insightful.

Let's look at a quick fictional example. Let's say the customer writes in and
asks:

"I just need to know if ya'll provide SEO for squirrel videos! I've looked
everywhere and I can't find anything! I bought this darn thing because I
thought you supported squirrel video SEO!"

If we don't have resources to point to, we're in reactive mode. We have to
reply:

"Sorry about that! We actually don't provide SEO support for squirrel videos!"

To which they reply very angrily.

You'd be surprised how much your customers will research before they ever reach
out. And it's no surprise! No one wants to email the know-it-alls in support
and feel dumb.

You can't solve all the questions like this, but the Heavy Weight approach
means if you identify this as a frequently asked question, you create
documentation for it, or include it in your onboarding resources.

This leads to a much better conversation:

"Hey, I've checked your documentation, and I see you don't provide SEO support
for squirrel videos. Can you please do this in the future?"

Ah, much better. We make our customer feel better, and set better expectations,
and we end up in a valuable conversation.

## Everyone wanna be a bodybuilder, but no one want to lift those heavy ass
weights

The other thing we don't want is to limit the people we connect with to just
those high-touch customers that reach out in support. Customers that connect
with us, stay longer.

But in the light-weight approach, customers that don't email support, don't
connect with us. So we might even "cold email" them, practically beg them to
talk to us, just to make sure they get the personal touch.

This is making the focus all about us, instead of about what the customer
needs.

The Heavy Weight approach, instead, connects with even self-service customers
with resources crafted in our own voice. Even if they never email us for
support, they get to know our personality and brand through our webinars,
support videos, and documentation.

## Pictures of us

We've produced video that shows off the faces of everyone in the company (the
slides behind me). The lower email volume means high-touch customers get better
attention from our support team. It's a win for all.

Give your users heavy weight resources from minute one, before they are in need
of support. It will result in a stronger, more valuable relationship.

## Takeaway

So, big takeaway numero dos - If your heavy weight support resources are
crafted in your own voice and reflecting your brand personality, using them is
actually the best way to scale your brand voice.

## Big Slide of Progress

I guess the third benefit is the most obvious.

Because we aren't slammed with the volume of support that a light-weight
practitioner is, we get to build an amazing team, slowly and thoughtfully.

The top line is our new user growth, and the bottom line is our total support
requests. Early on we were increasing total support volume by a number about
equal to our new customers, meaning for each new user we'd have another email
that month.

Today, our monthly support volume is less than 5% of our total user base.

When you are on-boarding happy customers who don't require a lot of high-touch,
you get a graph that looks like this. And you are happy.

What's really crazy here is our percentage churn, which has not only stayed
low, but actually decreased over this time.

## yeah buddy!

## video SEO function in the Product

I thought I would tell you a quick anecdote that illustrates how we've kept
support requests low.

At Wistia, our Video SEO feature is one of the big differentiators for us and
we draw lots of new customers because of it.

Now thatâ€™s awesome, but itâ€™s also one of our most confusing features, because
it requires the user to do a bunch of work and there are several moving parts
involved.

At one point, we were receiving ten to twenty emails a day with folks who were
confused by the Video SEO feature, or had missed a step and now it wasnâ€™t
working.

I'm sure I don't have to tell this crowd - when your product isn't working as
the customer expects, it's a very serious problem.

## Video in sidebar

Over coffee one morning, Chris and I decided to shoot a video outlining the
required Video SEO feature steps.

We based the script on the emails we were already sending, so it didn't take
that long to whip it together. Maybe an hour to script, setup, and shoot.

When it was ready, we added it to the Video SEO tool page inside our customer
accounts. The video also had a post-roll call-to-action, which pointed the
viewer to more resources in our documentation.

## Video itself

Here is the video!

## Stats for Video SEO

Overnight, those emails disappeared. I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I say
they went to zero.

This is what the stats looked like for that video after a few weeks. Over two
thousand views, and almost 30 hours of video watched.

Think about that - that's 30 hours of help and hand-holding we didn't have to
provide.

## pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K

So if we aren't doing a lot of hand-holding...what the heck does our team do?

Good question!

From a high level, the customer support role changes dramatically under the
heavy weight approach. Because we aren't spending our time regurgitating
answers, we can identify the core issues our customers face.

We also have the time to look critically at what we're spending our time doing,
so that we can constantly improve.

## The Inbox is Only the Beginning

When you adopt the heavy weight approach, the inbox is only the beginning.

Our small team is full of really smart, really talented people who improve our
customerâ€™s lives in so many ways.

## Max and Jordan pics

Max and Jordan, for example, run a weekly web show where they welcome Wistia
newbies into the fray. The whole thing is improv, so they get to talking heavy
metal and whiskey with our new customers more than you'd think.

## Mercer

This is Mercer. Mercer is always working with the development team to identify
fixes for deep technical problems, which delight our long-time customers.

## The Inbox is Only the Beginning

With a focus on scalable resources, there is no limit to the type of things you
can build to help your customers be more awesome. You can also focus on hiring
amazing people who will push your customer experience even further.

Customers, in turn, will thank you (with their money) for considering their
time and helping them achieve their goals.

## Takeaway 3

You will not automate away people by adopting a heavy ass weight approach.
Instead, you will give them the headroom and the freedom to make amazing things
and give your customers superpowers.

## MAKE IT F'ing AWESOME

For the rest of my time I want to talk about the Heavy Ass weights our team has
created, and give you some tactical suggestions for making yours awesome.

## Screenshot of Wistia Documentation

Let's get to the examples! The first is documentation. Pretty much everyone in
the room has documentation, and I'm hoping one of my tips will help you make it
better.

## Screenshot 2

First, how do we use documentation? Let me count the ways. We include a link to
it in support emails, to train your customers to start looking in the docs. We
also place a link to it prominently in your app, so users looking to
self-service can find it without any trouble.

## Heavy Hittin' Docs

So what are my heavy hitting doc tips?

First, use your normal language, not robot speak. Look at emails you are
already sending that work, and pull out parts of that language for your
documentation. Also keep it readable in chunks - we don't have any doc pages
that are more than a 10 minute read.

Second, use lots of real interface images, and make the images as large as you
can. Help put your readers in the context of the app.

Make absolutely certain there is search functionality, and monitor common
searches for more ways to improve. In our app, we have a link to the
documentation in our header bar, and we also provide a way to search the
documentation from inside the application as well.

Think about who ends up in the documentation - lost folks who might be
frustrated. Set good context and help them!! I think we do a pretty good job in
our docs, always trying to get better. My favorite docs right now are Githubs.

## Support Video

Ok, video is a a little less obvious of an example. While screencasting
software has made it a lot easier to create help videos, it is still hard to do
well.

We have a whole getting started series on video...

## Screenshot 2

..and we link to it from every page of our app.

## Screenshot 3

We also have lots of videos sprinkled around the popular pages in our
documentation.

Video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support. The
viewer gets to watch you complete the actions they are looking to do, which
provides them a clear roadmap to how to get it done.

Video also takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users
with plenty of energy to GO DO the thing they came to do. Ever read a huge
block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? OK that's
what we want to avoid.

## Heavy Hittin' Video

Here are some tips for creating excellent support videos:

First, keep it focused. No one likes a super long and boring walkthrough. No
one. We set a goal in advance for what we will cover, and who it is for. If it
is for first-time users, then keep it to the basics. You can always supplement
with an expert-level video later.

Second, get your face on there! We use live-action bumpers with our videos to
increase engagement and connection. Remember, when done well, heavy weight
resources scale that personal connection better than email.

Finally, make it easy to update. Things will change in your app - keep the
original edit around, so you can drop in new screencasts when a button or menu
changes.

I think MailChimp are the gold standard when it comes to support videos - they
have so many and they are well produced. I've also included a link to our
Getting Started series.

## In-App Tool Tips

Next up are tool tips. Tool tips are the best for providing a little *nudge* to
keep your users going. We provide them in lots of little *friction* areas in
the account, hidden under the nifty question mark icons.

## Heavy Hittin' Tool Tips

So three tips for making great tool-tips:

* format them for clarity: if they are just a block of text, people won't read
  them.
* link out to relevant documentation. since these by nature have to be short,
  they won't cover everything. Include a link for more info.
* Use support speak, not marketing speak. People are trying to get things done
  in here.

## Where do I start?

Ok, I know I've thrown a lot at you. I want to help focus your thinking on
where to start.

Remember, the heavy weight approach systematically identifies common friction
spots and creates excellent resources to address them. In doing so, our number
one goal with our heavy weights has been to improve the first-run experience
our customers have.

## Patrick McKenzie

This quote by Patrick McKenzie sums it up pretty darn well.

So if you are looking for a place to start with all of this, start with those
initial workflows - the things that prove the value of your product and get
prospective customers reaching for their wallets.

Make sure those have beautiful, friendly documentation or clear, energetic
screencasts.

## Reminder: Your Time is Valuable

I want to close out by saying something that I don't think gets said enough.

## YOU ARE AWESOME

You are awesome. As support people, you spend countless hours communicating
with customers, walking them through our product, and documenting their
requests for the product team.

You are the front-line heros that make-or-break your company's future.

So I beg of you, if you only take one thing away from this talk: your time is
important. When you see something that is draining your time and preventing you
from doing next level work for your customers, automate it away.

Your customers don't need hand holding, and they don't need coddling. All they
need are clear, helpful support resources.

Make more happy customers. Lift some heavy ass weights. Thank you.

## Ain't Nothin But a Peanut!
