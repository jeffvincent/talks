Today, I'm here to talk to you about time. Specifically about your time, and
how you can make the most of it.

## Ronny Coleman and the Heavy Ass Weights

Who recognizes this guy? This is Ronny Coleman, an american powerlifter who has won Mr.
Olympia EIGHT TIMES. Ronny is a bit of a role model in our office - his
self-inspirational quips and quotes get yelled out quite a bit.

** PLAY RONNY COLEMAN SOUND EFFECT **

Most powerlifters subscribe to a central concept - lift really freaking heavy weights a
few times. Now the opposite, lifting really light weights many many times, is what
most support people do. I'm here to argue that you should approach your job in
support as a powerlifter.

## Support like a Powerlifter

How many people here send a lot of email. Like a lot. (HANDS)

For most of us support people, there's a *really* good chance the very next support
email you receive will be easy. A softball lob that even I could hit. 

That right there is a light weight! Something that isn't hard for you to do, but 
you have to spend all day lifting them to deliver value to your customer base. 
Again and again, you're lifting these light ass weights, but you gotta lift them 
all day in order to get the value.

What I want you to take away from this talk is just how valuable your time is,
and how time spent on really good static assets, on real heavy ass weights, can 
yield exponential results.

## Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support

That's why this talk is called **Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support**.

To set some context, and introduce what I consider to be the heavy weights, I
want to talk a little bit about my own experience.

## History of Support @ Wistia (shot us of, but younger?)

When I joined Wistia, it was still a pretty young company trying to find
traction. We were doing a lot of hand-holding, and it showed. Despite being
pretty small (6 at the time), three of us spent *most* of our time speaking
with prospective customers and answering their questions. It was a great way to
learn more about their needs and where they were coming from.

In early 2012 we launched some major product updates based on everything we had
learned from customers, and our little company started talking off pretty
rapidly. The phone was ringing almost constantly.

From a customer support perspective, we were at a bit of a crossroads. With
more requests coming in, we could either raise a bunch of money, hire a whole
bunch of sales people, and start hitting the phones - or we could look for
another way.

It all started with removing our phone number from our marketing website. It
was super scary for us - we had always gotten our new customer flow through the
phone. We had always been the nice guys, who were available to answer any
question during the day. We were the company that answered with a real human
after only two rings. To be honest, I think it was driven to a certain extent
by my hatred for the phone :)

When we decided to drop our phone number, we knew the only way our customer base 
would continue to grow would be if we could use our static resources to get
them the answers they needed. It was scary, and I had a couple tough nights
worrying about it. 

## Big Slide of Progress

I'm proud to stand up here in front of you and tell you how well it worked for
us. If you're looking at this graph - the top line is our new user growth, and
the bottom line is our total support requests. We've gone from a monthly support 
volume that about equaled our customer base, to an active support volume of
less than 1% of our total user base. 

## Why is this important? (pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K)

This is way more important than just headcount, or customer support people
sanity. If you're like me, you're only interested in hiring the insane people
anyway.

This is important because customer support, no matter how excellent, is not
empowering. It's making your users more dependent on you. Every time they want
to try something new, they think they have to call you. Or email you. Or
tweet at you.

No one got up this morning and said "I'm going to be excellent at an app!" They
certainly didn't say that about Wistia. They have something they want to accomplish, 
and our goal as customer-focused people is to get them there. Our goal is to
get them there as quickly and easily as possible, and waiting for a support
response is just never the best way.

## Picture of Jackie and Peter

To better illustrate this, I'd like to introduce you to one of my favorite 
customers, Jackie Monticup. Jackie and her husband Peter run MagicTricks.com - 
it's exactly what it sounds like, a magic tricks ecommerce site. Which is awesome.

Jackie and Peter spend their days shooting new magic trick promo videos, communicating
with their customers, and shipping out tricks for their excited magician
clientele.

At the end of the day, right at the end, after Peter has gone to bed, Jackie
logs into her Wistia account and starts uploading their new videos. She's not
looking to spend a ton of time in her Wistia account, or hear all about our new
features. When she needs help, an email isn't going to cut it - she can't wait
overnight for a response.

This situation, this exact situation, is why all SaaS companies *must* produce
excellent static resources. The fact that even when she needs help, Jackie
knows how to find our help docs and help videos, means she feels comfortable
and empowered to get her work done. It makes her happy using our product, which
makes us happy.

## The Heavy Ass Weights

So I've hopefully sold you on why these heavy ass weights are worth lifting.
For the rest of my time, I want to talk about what I consider the Heavy Ass
weights, and I want to hopefully give you some tactical suggestions for making
yours awesome. I'm going to cover these in the order that we made them.

The first is documentation. Pretty much everyone in the room has documentation,
right? If you are a b2b app, you need documentation.

**How do you use it?** 

Include a link to it in your emails, to train your customers
to start looking in the docs. Place the link to it prominently in your app, so
users looking to self-service can find it without trouble.

**How do you make it awesome?** 

Keep it simple, use lots of pictures, and make
the language friendly. Think about who ends up in the documentation - lost
folks who might be frustrated. Set good context and help them!!

Next, of course, is video. This one is a little less common, although
screencasting software has made the dreaded slow walkthrough of death more
popular. So I thought I'd sell you a bit more on creating video as part of your 
support.

FIRST: video takes the personal touch you've been providing via support for
years, and scales it up. Awesome. We use lots of real-people faces to build a
connection with those interested in support.

SECOND: video takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users 
with plenty of energy to GO DO the thing they came to do. Ever read a huge
block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? OK that's
what we want to avoid.

Finally, video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support.
Reading documentation outside of the interface is totally confusing and
useless. Having big blocks of text inside your interface is a good way to
encourage folks NOT to use your app. Video bridges that gap. You should make it.

**How do you use it?** 

Include links to it in your support emails. Have a place
for it to live (ours lives in our documentation) and make it a first-class
option for your new users. Remember, no one woke up this morning and wants to
become an expert at your app. Video seems like a low-investment option for them
to figure out what they want to do.

**How do you make it awesome?** 

Keep it nice and short. No one likes a super long and boring walkthrough. No one.
Second, get your face in there! Make it personal - people love that personal connection.

The final Heavy Ass Weight I want to cover here is our Web Show.

A few years ago, one of our big drains was *demo time*. Who here does demos?
Yeah they aren't the most fun thing in the world. They cover a lot of the same
stuff over and again. Whenever you spot that - good time to find something more
efficient.

Our Customer Champions Max and Jordan took on the concept of a weekly Web Show
for our newest users. Attendees get a quick walkthrough the major flows in our
app, and then they get some higher-level tips on using video marketing
effectively.

For me, the most important part of their web show is that it's FUN! They crack
a lot of jokes, take any and all questions live, and encourage lots of
participation. Instead of a dreaded hour of boring walkthrough of our app, it's
transformed into something that puts a smile on our customer's faces. They take
that away and go get stuff done in their accounts. It's awesome.

## Reminder: Your Time is Valuable

I want to close with a little bit more about you. And your time.

The **hero** support person is well known. They are awesome - spending endless
hours communicating with customers, walking them through the product,
communicating their requests to the product team, issuing bugs on their behalf.

We all love and respect the support hero. But here's what happens - that person
has all the font-line feedback and communications in their head, and no time to
get deep on sharing it.

The support hero doesn't have time to participate in new product walkthroughs,
or provide thoughtful feedback on new feature iterations. As a result, the
product goes out absent of context - it may solve customer problems, but
perhaps not in the way they'd like to use it. That creates more support, which
further buries our hero. It's a crappy, never ending cycle and no one wins!

I beg of you, if you only take one thing away from this talk: your time is
important. When you see something that is draining your time and preventing you
from doing next level work for your customers, find a way to automate it away.
Don't be afraid that just because you aren't personally interfacing with your
customer's, they will be angry with you. For most, that personal touch was
never important in the first place. All they need are clear, helpful support 
resources.

Make more happy customers. Lift some heavy ass weights. Thank you.
