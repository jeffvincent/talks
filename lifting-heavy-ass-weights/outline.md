Today, I'm here to talk to you about time. Specifically about your time, and
how you can make the most of it.

**Ronny Coleman on the Screen**

Who recognizes this guy? This is Ronny Coleman, a powerlifter who has won Mr.
Olympia EIGHT TIMES. Ronny is a bit of a role model in our office - his
self-inspirational quips and quotes get yelled out quite a bit.

Most powerlifters subscribe to a central concept - lift really heavy weights a
few times. The opposite, lifting really light weights many many times, is what
most support people do. I'm here to argue that you should approach your job in
support as a powerlifter.

How many people here send a lot of email. Like a lot.

So for most support people, there's a really good chance the very next support
email you receive will be easy. A softball lob that even I could hit. 

That's a light weight! But you spend all day lifting them, and that is how you
deliver value to your customer base. Again and again, you're lifting these
light ass weights, but you gotta lift them all day in order to get the value.

What I want you to take away from this talk is just how valuable your time is,
and how time spent on really good static assets, on real heavy ass weights, can 
yield exponential results.

That's why this talk is called **Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support**.

To set some context, and introduce what I consider to be the heavy weights, I
want to talk a little bit about my own experience.

When I joined Wistia, it was still a pretty young company trying to find
traction. We were doing a lot of hand-holding, and it showed. Despite being
pretty small (6 at the time), three of us spent *most* of our time speaking
with prospective customers and answering their questions. It was a great way to
learn more about their needs and where they were coming from.

In early 2012 we launched some major product updates based on everything we had
learned from customers, and our little company started talking off pretty
rapidly. The phone was ringing almost constantly.

From a customer support perspective, we were at a bit of a crossroads. With
more requests coming in, we could either raise a bunch of money, hire a whole
bunch of sales people, and start hitting the phones - or we could look for
another way.

It all started with removing our phone number from our marketing website. It
was super scary for us - we had always gotten our new customer flow through the
phone. We had always been the nice guys, who were available to answer any
question during the day. We were the company that answered with a real human
after only two rings. To be honest, I think it was driven to a certain extent
by my hatred for the phone :)

When we decided to drop our phone number, we knew the only way our customer base 
would continue to grow would be if we could use our static resources to get
them the answers they needed. It was scary, and I had a couple tough nights
worrying about it. 

**Now I throw up the big slide**

I'm proud to stand up here in front of you and tell you how well it worked for
us. If you're looking at this graph - the top line is our new user growth, and
the bottom line is our total support requests. We've gone from a monthly support 
volume that about equaled our customer base, to an active support volume of
less than 1% of our total user base. 

**Why is this important?** (pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K)

This is way more important than just headcount, or customer support people
sanity. If you're like me, you're only interested in hiring the insane people
anyway. Here are our insane people, btw.

This is important because customer support, no matter how excellent, is not
really empowering. It's training your users that every time they need to do
something just outside their expertise, they need to call you. Or email you. Or
tweet at you.

No one got up this morning and said "I'm going to be excellent at an app!" They
certainly didn't say that about Wistia. They have something they want to accomplish, 
and our goal as customer-focused people is to get them there. Our goal is to
get them there as quickly and easily as possible, and waiting for a support
response is never the best way.

**Picture of Jackie and Peter**

To better illustrate this, I think about one of my favorite customers, Jackie
Monticup. Jackie and her husband Peter run MagicTricks.com - it's just like it
sounds, a magic tricks ecommerce site. Which is awesome.

Jackie and Peter spend their days shooting new magic trick promo videos, communicating
with their customers, and shipping out tricks for their excited magician
clientele.

At the end of the day, right at the end, after Peter has gone to bed, Jackie
logs into her Wistia account and starts uploading their new videos. She's not 

**The Heavy Ass Weights**

So let's talk about my heavy ass weight list. Let's talk about which static
assets you should be going after.
