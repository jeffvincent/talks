## jeff face looking dumb

My first UserConf was in New York this past May. One of the things I was most
struck by was that everyone I met was a practitioner - meaning they were
actually working in support, or community, or customer experience.

That makes me really nervous and excited to talk to you today, since you are
all so smart and experienced. So here goes nothing.

## Wistia Sign

My name is Jeff, I work at Wistia. We're a video hosting and analytics platform
for business. We also have cute dogs.

## Growth Slide

Today I want to talk about growth.

As support people, we don't talk about growth enough, and I think that is
because it can be a bit of a sticky situation.

On one hand, customer growth is exciting! More new people are using our tools
and talking about our company, and your mom might start to recognize what you
are working on.

On the other hand, it also means more inquiries, support tickets, and requests
for "just 5 minutes" of our time.

## Young Wistia

At Wistia, we went through our first growth experience in early 2012. We had
released this new set of features, and for the first time we were really
separating ourselves from the competition. We were breaking down barriers for
lots of potential customers we never had a shot with before.

At first, the support increase was just a small uptick, a few extra emails here
or there.  Nothing to really be concerned about.

But slowly the uptick turned a full-on deluge.

The phones were ringing off the hook. The support inbox was turning over 3 or 4
times a day. It was just a constant stream of questions, suggestions, and
inquiries. I was drowning in support.

Many of you have probably experienced the feelings I was having. I was burned
out, exhausted, and generally sick of answering the same questions over and
over again.

## How to scale support?

So something had to change. In figuring out how we could scale support, we
evaluated three basic options.

## 3 Options (Money, Broken Phone, NEW WAY)

First, we could build a support army.

We could raise a bunch of money, hire a whole ton of folks, and stick them in a
call center or closet to answer emails and phone calls. They would probably
hate their jobs, stick around for a year or so, and then leave.

This would have been a cultural nightmare and a really tough route to make
work. None of us wanted to work at a company with a call center, and I really
didn't want to manage one. So that one was out.

Second, we could just make it impossible for any customers to contact us.

We could remove all of our phone numbers, close down support email addresses,
and just go dark. We could probably get by like that for a while, and even make
our product cheaper, since we wouldn't need to hire support people.

Our product would probably become a power users dream - only useful to really
experienced users. The only problem is, there wouldn't be any power users to
enjoy it.

So those two options seemed pretty terrible. We needed a third option. A
mythical hybrid creature. A NEW WAY.

## Show me the new way

We would somehow meld the best parts of options 1 and 2 together.

We would increase the number of customers that could communicate with us at
once AND present them self-service support options to reach for BESIDES our
contact info.

I've been working on this NEW WAY for a few years now, but I've been kinda
struggling on a name for it until recently. To properly introduce it, however,
I am going to need to beat the heck out of a metaphor.

## Ronny Coleman is really strong

Does anyone know who this is?

This is Ronny Coleman. Ronny is an American powerlifter who has won Mr. Olympia
EIGHT TIMES.

Ronny is also a really funny guy. His self-inspirational quips and quotes get
yelled out quite a bit.

## PLAY RONNY COLEMAN VIDEO

## "LIGHT WEIGHT BABY!"

So if you want to get strong like Ronny, you have two options. You could lift
light weights a bazillion times...or you could lift really freaking heavy
weights a few times.

Successful powerlifters like Ronny subscribe to the idea of heavier weights,
fewer lifts.

## “Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support”

How many people here send a lot of email? (HANDS OR CLAPS)

So we pretty much all do. The average support response we send is probably
pretty easy, something we've sent hundreds of times.

Support emails you can write in your sleep is like Ronny curling a 20 pound
dumbbell - it's a light weight!

Again and again, you're lifting these light weights, and you gotta lift them
all day in order to get the value. That is a light weight, heavy repetition
approach. It's exhausting, it uses up all your time, and it's not terribly
helpful to our customers, either.

It’s time to start viewing your job more like Ronny. It's time to start using
the Heavy Ass Weights of Support.

Heavy weight support is an approach - it is systematically looking at the those
support conversations we have again and again - those frough spots in our
customer's experience - and creating useful resources to help educate our
customers and get them going again.

## Heavy Weight Examples

The heavy weight resources are things you are probably all familiar with, like
documentation, in-app help, webinars, and screencasts.

You know these things can help your customers - the challenge is prioritizing
them and doing them well. My job is to convince you to do the work on these up
front, rather than the easy light-weight equivalent, because these resources
pay huge, scalable dividends over time for you and your customers.

## Heavy Ass Weight Key benefits

So the first part of my talk today is to highlight the big benefits of the
heavy ass weight approach.

Then, the second part will be some of my tips for creating excellent support
resources.

I've boiled my perspective on this approach down to three key benefits:

The heavy weight approach creates badass users, helps us connect with them at
scale, and also helps us build incredibly talented teams.

So let's get started with creating badass users.

## Heavy Ass Weights => Badass Users

Kathy Sierra coined this term in her talk at Business of Software 2012,
Building the Minimum Badass User. After UserConf, you should totally go check
that talk out, if you haven't already.

(add extra pause)

When she said "badass", she was using it as a synonym for "expert". Badass
users know how to get shit done using your app, and are confident using it.
Creating badass users means getting over trying to impress customers, and
instead help customers impress their end user.

As support folks, our end goal has always been to create badass users. We are
educators and map builders, guiding our customers to creating awesome things.

## The Heavy Ass Weights are Empowering

But the heavy weight approach creates more badass users, faster than the light
weight approach because it is a more empowering experience.

Let's say a customer wants to do something common, so in my world it might be
customizing a video, and they don't know where to start.

In the light weight approach, the confused user has to drop an email to
support, or call a help line, in order to move forward.  They might even have
their own account rep, who is there to answer their every question.

Customers get conditioned that when they want to try something new, they have
to call you. Or email you. Or tweet at you. Customers become frozen with fear
about trying something new. They have no forward momentum.

With the heavy weight approach, we would identify customizing as an important
workflow to learn. We would make sure there was a prominent link in our
documentation for help, and an in-app tool tip that gets them through the action.

The thing is, our customers don't learn by being held by the hand. They learn
by tinkering, by understanding how the pieces fit together.

Using a well-designed, thorough resource means they learned it on their own.
This leads to more confidence, which leads to more exploration and ultimately more doing.

## Takeaway

To wrap up this point: Heavy weight support enables your users to
accomplish their task, again and again, on their timetable - no more waiting
for you and your email response.

## HAW create personal connection

So the first big benefit of the Heavy Ass Weights is they create Badass users.

The second is a little less intuitive. When I'm yammering away about the Heavy Weight approach, lots of folks tell me
they are scared a more self-service approach will lead to them losing contact
with their customers.

I'm here to tell you nothing could be further from the truth.

## We are not automatons

Let's take a quick look at how we create this connection with our customers.

In a light-weight, high rep approach, we the support people have all the power.
This means customers will come to us confused, frustrated, maybe a little
hungry. They might say things like:

"Dangit! I just need to know if ya'll provide SEO for squirrel videos! I've
looked everywhere and I can't find anything!"

to which we have to reply:

"Sorry about that! We actually don't provide SEO support for squirrel videos!"

To which they reply very angrily. Because we don't have resources that set
expectations for them, we are stuck in a reactive mode. There is a connection
being made here, but it's not a positive one.

If by contrast we had good SEO documentation, perhaps with a frequently
asked question section that covered squirrel video SEO, the conversation might
go more like:

"Hey, I've checked your documentation, and I see you don't provide SEO support
for squirrel videos. Can you please do this in the future?"

Ah, much better. We make our customer feel better, and set better expectations,
and we end up in a valuable conversation.

You'd be surprised how much your customers will research before they ever reach
out. And it's no surprise! No one wants to email the know-it-alls in support
and feel all dumb.

## images of us

The other important part of creating a personal connection with our customer is
how they get to know us as people.

That first time your customer uses your app is the most important. They will
form an opinion of you in the first run that will be *extremely* hard to
change.

So if they run into trouble, you're screwed! The support context is a terrible
place to meet people. The customer is stressed, the support person has a queue
out the door - it's a recipe for disaster.

Make sure your customer has ready access to resources that can get them through
the most important steps in your application. In preparing those resources,
think about showing off your entire company. You get the double benefit of
customers having a smoother experience, and giving them a chance to get to know the people behind the product.

Use your heavy weight resources to proactively connect with your customers,
before they are in need of support. It will result in a stronger, more valuable
relationship.

## Takeaway

So, big takeaway numero dos - If your heavy weight support resources are
crafted in your own voice and reflecting your brand personality, using them is
actually the best way to scale your brand voice.

## Big Slide of Progress

I guess the third benefit is the most obvious.

Because we aren't slammed with the volume of support that a light-weight
practitioner is, we get to build an amazing team, slowly and thoughtfully.

The top line is our new user growth, and the bottom line is our total support
requests. Early on we were increasing total support volume by a number about
equal to our new customers, meaning for each new user we'd have another email
that month.

Today, our monthly support volume is less than 5% of our total user base.

When you are on-boarding happy customers who don't require a lot of high-touch,
you get a graph that looks like this. And you are happy.

What's really crazy here is our percentage churn, which has not only stayed
low, but actually decreased over this time.

## yeah buddy!

## video SEO function in the Product

I thought I would tell you a quick anecdote that illustrates how we've kept
support requests low.

At Wistia, our Video SEO feature is one of the big differentiators for us and
we draw lots of new customers because of it.

Now that’s awesome, but it’s also one of our most confusing features, because
it requires the user to do a bunch of work and there are several moving parts
involved.

At one point, we were receiving ten to twenty emails a day with folks who were
confused by the Video SEO feature, or had missed a step and now it wasn’t
working.

I'm sure I don't have to tell this crowd - when your product isn't working as
the customer expects, it's a very serious problem.

## Video in sidebar

Over coffee one morning, Chris and I decided to shoot a video outlining the
required Video SEO feature steps.

We based the script on the emails we were already sending, so it didn't take
that long to whip it together. Maybe an hour to script, setup, and shoot.

When it was ready, we added it to the Video SEO tool page inside our customer
accounts. The video also had a post-roll call-to-action, which pointed the
viewer to more resources in our documentation.

## Video itself

Here is the video!

## Stats for Video SEO

Overnight, those emails disappeared. I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I say
they went to zero.

This is what the stats looked like for that video after a few weeks. Over two
thousand views, and almost 30 hours of video watched.

Think about that - that's 30 hours of help and hand-holding we didn't have to
provide.

## pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K

So if we aren't doing a lot of hand-holding...what the heck does our team do?

Good question!

## The Inbox is Only the Beginning

When you adopt the heavy weight approach, the inbox is only the beginning.

Our small team is full of really smart, really talented people who improve our
customer’s lives in so many ways.

## Max and Jordan pics

Max and Jordan, for example, run a weekly web show where they welcome Wistia
newbies into the fray. The whole thing is improv, so they get to talking heavy
metal and whiskey with our new customers more than you'd think.

## Mercer

This is Mercer. Mercer is always working with the development team to identify
fixes for deep technical problems, which delight our long-time customers.

## The Inbox is Only the Beginning

With a focus on scalable resources, there is no limit to the type of things you
can build for your customers. They will thank you (with their money) for
considering their time and helping them achieve their goals.

## Takeaway 4

You will not automate away people by adopting a heavy ass weight approach.
Instead, you will give them the headroom and the freedom to make amazing things
and give your customers superpowers.

## MAKE IT F'ing AWESOME

For the rest of my time I want to talk about the Heavy Ass weights our team has
created, and give you some tactical suggestions for making yours awesome.

## Screenshot of Wistia Documentation

The first is documentation. Pretty much everyone in the room has documentation,
right? If you are a b2b app, you need documentation.

## Screenshot 2

Include a link to it in your emails, to train your customers to start looking
in the docs. Place the link to it prominently in your app, so users looking to
self-service can find it without trouble.

## Heavy Hittin' Docs

Keep it simple, use lots of pictures, and make the language friendly.

Think about who ends up in the documentation - lost folks who might be
frustrated. Set good context and help them!!

## Support Video

Next, of course, is video. This one is a little less common, although
screencasting software has made it a lot easier. Still hard to do well.

We have a whole getting started series on video...

## Screenshot 2

..and we link to it from every page of our app.

Video takes the personal touch you've been providing via support for years, and
scales it up. Awesome.

SECOND: video takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users
with plenty of energy to GO DO the thing they came to do. Ever read a huge
block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? OK that's
what we want to avoid.

Finally, video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support.
Reading documentation outside of your product is totally confusing and useless.
Having big blocks of text inside your interface is a good way to encourage
folks NOT to use your app. Video bridges that gap. You should make it.

## Heavy Hittin' Video

Keep it nice and short. No one likes a super long and boring walkthrough. No
one.

Second, get your face on there! Make it personal - people love that personal
connection.

Third, make it easy to update. Things will change in your app - keep the
original edit around, so you can drop in new screencasts when a button or menu
changes.

## In-App Tool Tips

Tool tips are the best for providing that little *nudge* that keeps your users
going. We provide them in lots of little *friction* areas in the account,
hidden under the nifty question mark icons.

## Heavy Hittin' Tool Tips

So three tips for making great tool-tips:

* format them for clarity: if they are just a block of text, people won't read
  them.
* link out to relevant documentation. since these by nature have to be short,
  they won't cover everything. Include a link for more info.
* Use support speak, not marketing speak. People are trying to get things done
  in here.

## Reminder: Your Time is Valuable

I want to close out by saying something that I don't think gets said enough.

## YOU ARE AWESOME

You are awesome. As support people, you spend countless hours communicating
with customers, walking them through our product, and documenting their
requests for the product team.

You are the front-line heros that make-or-break your company's future.

So I beg of you, if you only take one thing away from this talk: your time is
important. When you see something that is draining your time and preventing you
from doing next level work for your customers, automate it away.

Your customers don't need hand holding, and they don't need coddling. All they
need are clear, helpful support resources.

Make more happy customers. Lift some heavy ass weights. Thank you.
