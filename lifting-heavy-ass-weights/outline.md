## slide: JEFF FACE LOOKING DUMB

My first UserConf was in New York this past May. One of the things I was most
struck by was that everyone I met was a practitioner - they were actually
working in support, or community, or customer experience. That makes me really
nervous and excited to talk to you today, since you are all so smart and
experienced. So here goes nothing.

--- Which Story is a better opener? ---

## STORY 1: VIDEO SEO FUNCTION in the Product

At Wistia, our Video SEO feature is one of those big differentiators and we
draw lots of new customers because of it.

Now that’s awesome, but it’s also one of our most confusing features, because
it requires the user to do some outside work in order to be compliant with
Google’s restrictions.

At one point, we were receiving ten to twenty emails a day with folks who were
confused by the Video SEO feature, or had missed a step and now it wasn’t
working.

I'm sure I don't have to tell this crowd - when your product isn't working as
the customer expects, it's a very serious problem.

##SLIDE: Video in sidebar

In 20 minutes, Chris and I shot a video outlining the required Video SEO
feature steps, and then we added it to the product page with a call-to-action
to read more in our documentation.

Overnight, those emails disappeared. I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I
say they went to zero. And there is more - smart SEO firms like Distilled
started referring to us as a good platform for SEO for Video Marketers. That is
a really huge deal!

## SLIDE: Stats for Video SEO

I pull these stats after having that video in the sidebar for few weeks. It was
definitely getting some watches - and LOOK AT THAT: almost 30 hours of video
watched. That is a lot of emails and support calls that were solved in a
quicker, better way.



## slide: Ronny Coleman is really strong

Does anyone know who this is?

This is Ronny Coleman. He is an American powerlifter who has won Mr. Olympia
EIGHT TIMES. Holy shit!

Ronny is also a really really funny guy. He’s become a bit of a role model in
our office - his self-inspirational quips and quotes get yelled out quite a bit.

** PLAY RONNY COLEMAN SOUND EFFECT **

So if you want to get strong like Ronny, you have two options. You could lift
relatively light weights a bazillion times...or you could lift really freaking
heavy weights a few times.

Now Ronny, like most successful powerlifters, subscribes to the idea of heavier
weights, fewer lifts. I think you see where I’m going with this.

Now - how many people here send a lot of email? (HANDS)

The average email they receive is an easy response, something they have sent
hundreds of times. A softball lob even I could hit!

That right there is an example of a light weight! Something that isn't hard for
you to do, but you have to spend all day lifting them to deliver value to your
customer base.

Another example is the typical sales phone call. You’re basically reading from a
script, just talking about the benefits of your product.

Again and again, you're lifting these light weights, but you gotta lift them all
day in order to get the value. That is a heavy rep, light weight approach.

## slide: “Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support”

I’ve learned, and now I pass on to all of you, that it’s time to start
approaching your job like Ronny.

## slide: Documentation, In-App Help, Screencasts, Webinars

Heavy weight support resources like documentation, in-app help, and screencasts
may take a lot of work upfront, but pay huge, scalable dividends over time for
you and your customers.

First we're going to talk about the benefits of the Heavy Ass Weights for your
team, then we'll talk about them from the user point-of-view, then we'll talk
about how to make them great.

## SLIDE: Big Slide of Progress

So fast forward two and a half years or so. Some of you might have seen this in
your email. I'm really proud to show you this graph. What I also wish I could show is
our percentage churn, which has not only stayed low, but actually decreased over
this time.

The top line is our new user growth, and the bottom line is our total support
requests. We've gone from a monthly support volume that about equaled our
customer base, to a support volume of less than 1% of our total user base.

Ok, now I’m going to tell you how to get here.

## SLIDE: Heavy Ass Weights are empowering

So why are these heavy ass weights so important? Well customer support, no
matter how excellent it is, just isn’t empowering.

As a customer, sending an email to support and waiting for a response makes them
more dependent on you. Every time they want to try something new, they feel like
they have to call you. Or email you. Or tweet at you. Customers are frozen with
fear about moving forward on their own.

## SLIDE: SOMETHING THEY WANTED TO DO

No one got up this morning and said "I'm going to be excellent at an app!" They
certainly didn't say that about Wistia. They have something they want to
accomplish, and our goal as customer-focused people is to get them there, as
quickly and easily as possible.

Waiting for a response from your support team is just never the best way.

## SLIDE: HEAVY WEIGHTS = BADASS USERS

Using heavy weights to drive our customer onboarding and communication, on the
other hand, makes what Kathy Sierra calls “badass users”. Heavy weight support
enables your users to accomplish their task, again and again, on their timetable -
no more waiting for you and your email response.

Our email volume has stayed so constant because our users have resources that
help them learn the basics - the only questions that hit our support inbox are
real technical issues and feature requests.

If they have a question, the heavy weight trained user knows where to look for
the answer, and it’s not to our support email.

## SLIDE: HEAVY WEIGHTS != Personal contact

The first question I hear from people is they worry that, by implementing these
support resources, they will lose contact with their customers and lose the
personal connection they used to have. I'm here to tell you nothing could be
further from the truth.

We still receive lots of communication every day from our customers - it just
comes along later, once they've really gotten to know us. They get to know our
product and personality through our videos and other support resources, and it
creates a personal and emotional connection.

## SLIDE: EMAIL IMAGE?

When they do have to write into support (it still happens!) they almost always
lead off with "First, we love Wistia", and then dive into the core of their
technical issue. This makes support a lot more fun to tackle (it's amazing, and
we're hiring - come find me later).

Instead of relying on the support person's mood or whim to make the strong
connection in the first few emails, we lead with consistently bright, cheery,
and helpful videos and documentation. No back and forth required.

## WE ARE NOT AUTOMATONS

The second question I get is some riff on "are you trying to automate away all
your support? Will the robots take over support at Wistia?" Our job is not to
automate away all support conversations - we're realistic to
know that isn't possible, and it is really valuable to be able to connect with
customers around their problems.

But what we do strive for is creating the smoothest path from first touch to
experiencing the **core value** of the product. Your goal should be for your
heavy weights to cover all the basic workflows of your
product - enough to get your users to discover the value and then reach for
their wallets.

## SLIDE: pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K

The third question I get is about our team. After I talk about my vision for
support, I occasionally have applicants ask me if their job is safe, if I
really want to automate away more and more conversations.

For those who get it, you know. The inbox is only the beginning.

Because our inbox and phone call volume is no longer directly tied to customer
growth, we haven’t had to hire a whole bunch of recent college grads, chain them
to a desk, and flood them with customer calls every day. Instead, I’m able to
hire a few really smart, really talented people who improve our customer’s lives
in so many ways.

Max and Jordan, for example, run a weekly web show where they welcome Wistia
newbies into the fray. The whole thing is improv, so they get to talking heavy
metal and whiskey with our new customers more than you'd think. They always
come out of the show laughing with really raving reviews. Contrast that to your 
average 1 on 1 demos, and it's a great way to provide folks who need a little
extra hand-holding a great experience without it being a time suck.

Mercer is always working with the development team to identify fixes for deep
technical problems, which delight our long-time customers. Contrast that with
your typical bug reports and strained relationship between support and
development.

With a focus on scalable resources, there is no limit to the type of things you
can build for your customers. They will thank you (with their money) for
considering their time and helping them achieve their goals.

In short, lifting heavy ass weights allows you to build a support experience
your customers have probably never had before.

## SLIDE: Peter and Jackie Monticup

I figured no presentation on users would be complete without a living,
breathing user, so I'd like to introduce you to one of my favorite
customers, Jackie Monticup. Jackie and her husband Peter run MagicTricks.com -
it's exactly what it sounds like, a magic tricks ecommerce site. Which is
awesome.

Jackie and Peter spend their days shooting new magic trick promo videos,
communicating with their customers, and shipping out tricks for their excited
magician clientele.

When Jackie started using Wistia, she didn’t have much experience with using web
apps OR web video. She also couldn’t spend a ton of time waiting for us to get
back to her with a support response.

Jackie is what Jeff Lawson from Twilio calls a **DOER**. She is not interested
in being sold to, or having her hand held. She has a mission and she wants to
get it done.

## SLIDE: Wistia Basics page

When she started overhauling the MagicTricks.com website and adding Wistia
embedded videos, she turned to our Wistia Basics video series for help.

She was able to learn the ins-and-outs of customization and embedding, and I’m
now proud to call her an expert. She is a happy customer who feels comfortable
and empowered to get her work done.

When she needs it, Jackie knows how to find our help docs and help videos. It
makes her happy using our product, which makes me happy.



## SLIDE: MAKE IT FUCKING AWESOME

At Wistia, one of our core values is “make it fucking awesome”. I like to think
we’ve stayed true to that with our versions of the heavy ass weights.

For the rest of my time I want to talk about the Heavy Ass weights our team has
created, and give you some tactical suggestions for making yours awesome.

## SLIDE: Screenshot of Wistia Documentation

The first is documentation. Pretty much everyone in the room has documentation,
right? If you are a b2b app, you need documentation.

**How do you use it?**

Include a link to it in your emails, to train your customers to start looking
in the docs. Place the link to it prominently in your app, so users looking to
self-service can find it without trouble.

**How do you make it awesome?**

Keep it simple, use lots of pictures, and make the language friendly. Think
about who ends up in the documentation - lost folks who might be frustrated.
Set good context and help them!!

Next, of course, is video. This one is a little less common, although
screencasting software has made the dreaded slow walkthrough of death more
popular. So I thought I'd sell you a bit more on creating video as part of your
support.

FIRST: video takes the personal touch you've been providing via support for
years, and scales it up. Awesome. We use lots of real-people faces to build a
connection with those interested in support.

SECOND: video takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users
with plenty of energy to GO DO the thing they came to do. Ever read a huge
block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? OK that's
what we want to avoid.

Finally, video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support.
Reading documentation outside of your product is totally confusing and useless.
Having big blocks of text inside your interface is a good way to encourage
folks NOT to use your app. Video bridges that gap. You should make it.

**How do you use video?**

Include links to it in your support emails. Have a place for it to live (ours
lives in our documentation) and make it a first-class option for your new
users.  Remember, no one woke up this morning and wants to become an expert at
your app.  Video seems like a low-investment option for them to figure out what
they want to do.

**How do you make it awesome?**

Keep it nice and short. No one likes a super long and boring walkthrough. No
one.  Second, get your face on there! Make it personal - people love that
personal connection.

The final Heavy Ass Weight I want to cover here is our Web Show.

A few years ago, one of our big drains was *demo time*. Who here does demos?
(hands) Yeah they aren't the most fun thing in the world, totally light
weights.  They cover a lot of the same stuff over and again. Whenever you spot
that - good time to find something more efficient.

Our Customer Champions Max and Jordan took on the concept of a weekly Web Show
for our newest users. Attendees get a quick walkthrough the major flows in our
app, and then they get some higher-level tips on using video marketing
effectively.

For me, the most important part of their web show is that it's FUN! They crack
a lot of jokes, take any and all questions live, and encourage lots of
participation. Instead of a dreaded hour of boring walkthrough of our app, it's
transformed into something that puts a smile on our customer's faces. They take
that away and go get stuff done in their accounts. It's awesome.

## Reminder: Your Time is Valuable

I want to close with a little bit more about you. And your time.

The **hero** support person is well known. They are awesome - spending endless
hours communicating with customers, walking them through the product,
communicating their requests to the product team, issuing bugs on their behalf.

We all love and respect the support hero. But here's what happens - that person
has all the front-line feedback and communications in their head, and no time
to get deep on sharing it.

The support hero doesn't have time to participate in new product walkthroughs,
or provide thoughtful feedback on new feature iterations. As a result, the
product goes out absent of context - it may solve customer problems, but
perhaps not in the way they'd like to use it. That creates more support, which
further buries our hero. It's a crappy, never ending cycle and no one wins!

I beg of you, if you only take one thing away from this talk: your time is
important. When you see something that is draining your time and preventing you
from doing next level work for your customers, find a way to automate it away.
Don't be afraid that just because you aren't personally interfacing with your
customer's, they will be angry with you. For most, that personal touch was
never important in the first place. All they need are clear, helpful support
resources.

Make more happy customers. Lift some heavy ass weights. Thank you.
