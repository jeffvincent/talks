## jeff face looking dumb

My first UserConf was in New York this past May. One of the things I was most
struck by was that everyone I met was a practitioner - meaning they were
actually working in support, or community, or customer experience.

That makes me really nervous and excited to talk to you today, since you are
all so smart and experienced. So here goes nothing.

## Wistia Sign

My name is Jeff, I work at Wistia. We're a video hosting and analytics platform
for business. We also have cute dogs.

Today I want to talk about growth.

As support people, I don't think we talk about growth enough. I think that is
because it can be a bit of a double-edged sword.

On one hand, customer growth is exciting! More new people are using our tools
and talking about our company, and our friends and family might even approve of
what we're working on.

On the other hand, growth also means more support tickets, more feature requests,
and more requests for "just 5 minutes" of our time.

## Young Wistia

At Wistia, we went through our first growth spurt in early 2012. We had
released this new set of features, and for the first time we were really
separating ourselves from the competition. We were breaking down barriers for
lots of potential customers we never had a shot with before.

At first, the support increase was just a small uptick, a few extra emails here
or there.  Nothing to really be concerned about.

## oh yeah, we did

But slowly the uptick turned into a full-on monsoon.

The phones were ringing off the hook. The support inbox was filling up faster
than I could clean it out. I was drowning in support.

Many of you have probably experienced what I was feeling at that time. I was
burned out, exhausted, and generally sick of answering the same questions over
and over again.

## How to scale support?

So something had to change. In figuring out how we could scale support, we
evaluated three basic options.

## 3 Options (Money, Broken Phone, NEW WAY)

First, we could build a support army.

We could raise a bunch of money, hire a ton of new folks, and stick them in a
closet to do nothing but answer emails and phone calls.

This, for us, would have been a cultural nightmare. So that option was out.

Second, we could just make it impossible for any customers to contact us.

We could remove all of our phone numbers, close down support email addresses,
and just go dark. We could probably get by like that for a while, but one of
the true joys of my life at Wistia is being able to problem solve for our
customers.

So neither of those options worked for us. We needed a third one - this
mythical, hybrid creature.

We needed a NEW WAY.

## Show me the new way

This new way would have to increase the number of customers that could
communicate with us at once AND present them support options BESIDES our
contact info.

We've been working with this new approach for a few years now, and I'm really
excited to tell you about it today. But first, I want to introduce my inspiration.

## Ronny Coleman is really strong

Does anyone know who this is?

This is Ronny Coleman. Ronny is an American powerlifter who has won Mr. Olympia
EIGHT TIMES. For comparison, Arnold only one it seven times. Whatup, Arnold.

Ronny is also a really funny guy. He has these self-inspirational quotes that
we've adopted, and get yelled out quite a bit around our office. Let's take a
look at some of my favorites.

## PLAY RONNY COLEMAN VIDEO

## "LIGHT WEIGHT BABY!"

So if you want to get strong like Ronny, you have two options. You could lift
light weights a bazillion times...or you could lift really freaking heavy
weights a few times.

Successful powerlifters like Ronny subscribe to the idea of heavier weights,
fewer lifts. What I'm here to argue is that we should be approaching our
customer-facing jobs like a Mr. Olympia-style power lifter.

It's time to start lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support.

## Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support

So quick survey - how many people here send a lot of email? (HANDS OR CLAPS)

Ok, we pretty much all do. And the average support response we send is probably
pretty easy, something we've sent dozens or even hundreds of times.

Support emails you can write in your sleep is like Ronny curling a 20 pound
dumbbell - it's a light weight!

Again and again, you're lifting these light weights, and you gotta lift them
all day in order to get the value. That is a light weight, heavy rep approach.
It's exhausting, it uses up all your time, and it's not terribly helpful to our
customers, either.

Heavy weight support means systematically looking at the those support conversations
we have again and again - those rough spots in our customer's experience - and
creating useful resources to help educate our customers and get them going.

Just to be clear, Heavy weight support is not purely self-service, however. We
still send lots of emails and we even have phone support! Those higher-touch
routes are just not the first option for a stuck customer.

## Heavy Weight Examples

So now I hope you're familiar with the approach, and you might be asking what
heavy weight resources are.

They are nothing new - they are things like documentation, in-app help,
webinars, and screencasts.

Resources that you know can help your customers - the challenge is prioritizing
them, and doing them well. Too often we decide to just do the light weight
work, answering frequently asked questions, or just keep providing 1-on-1 demos.

My job is to convince you to allocate more of your time for Heavy Weight
resources, because doing them well pays huge dividends over time for you and
your customers.

## Heavy Ass Weight Key benefits

So the first part of my talk today is to highlight the big benefits of this
approach. Then, the second part will be some of my tips for creating excellent
support resources.

So a high-level view the big benefits: lifting heavy ass weights creates badass
users, it helps us connect with them at scale, and also helps us build
incredibly talented teams.

So let's get started with creating badass users.

## Heavy Ass Weights => Badass Users

I'm stealing a Kathy Sierra term on this one. When she said "badass", she was
using it as a synonym for "expert". Badass users (or experts) know how to get
shit done using your app, and are confident using it.

As support folks, our end goal has always been to create badass users. We are
educators and map builders by trade, guiding our customers to creating awesome
things.

## The Heavy Ass Weights are Empowering

The heavy weight approach creates more badass users faster than the light
weight alternative because it is a more empowering experience.

Let's say a customer wants to do something common, so in my world it might be
customizing a video, and they don't know where to start.

## Hand-holding support is not empowering

In the light weight approach, the confused person has to drop an email to
support, or call a help line, in order to move forward.

Over time, confused customers get conditioned that when they want to try
something new, they have to call you. Or email you. They become frozen with fear
about trying something new.

I don't believe we learn best by being held by the hand. We learn
by tinkering, by understanding how all the pieces fit together.

## Train harder and grow bigger

With the heavy weight approach, a common activity like this would get a
prominent, well-thought out doc page guiding them through the process. We might 
shoot a screencast for it, and include an in-app tool tip that gets stuck users
going again.

A well-designed, thorough resource means they learn it on their own. This leads
to more confidence, which leads to more exploration and ultimately more doing.

## Big Slide of Progress

So here is how I illustrate the growth of our badass users.

When you are on-boarding happy customers and giving them lots of good resources,
you get a graph that looks like this. And you are happy.

The top line here is our new user growth, and the bottom line is our total
support requests. Early on each new user we added meant another email or phone
call that month.

Today, our monthly support volume is less than 5% of our total user base.

## yeah buddy!

That gets a "yeah buddy". What's crazy is that our percentage churn has
actually decreased over that period as well.

## Takeaway

So to wrap up this point: Heavy weight support enables your users to accomplish
their task, again and again, on their timetable.

## badass users want self-service help

So the first big benefit of the Heavy Ass Weights is they create Badass users.

Now that we've created all these badass users, how do we connect with them?

In my experience, badass users aren't looking for hand-holding when they run
into a problem. Instead, they are looking for helpful resources they can refer
to again and again.

So what might hold us back from adopting this approach?

The fear, I think, is that self-service support will lead to a disconnect with
our loving customers. I'm here to tell you that nothing could be further from
the truth.

## the inbox is a terrible place to meet people.

Too often, the connection we are currently creating with our customers
originates in the support inbox.

But the support context is a terrible place to meet people! The customer is
stressed, the support person has a queue out the door - it's a recipe for
disaster.

What if instead of waiting for them, we created resources that walked them
through the getting started workflows, and then started adding frequently asked
questions to those resources?

Suddenly our conversations go from being reactive, from having to reset
expectations and beg for forgiveness, to being valuable and insightful.

Let's look at a quick fictional example. Let's say the customer writes in and
asks:

"I just need to know if ya'll provide SEO for squirrel videos! I've looked
everywhere and I can't find anything! I bought this darn thing because I
thought you supported squirrel video SEO!"

If we don't have resources to point to, we're in reactive mode. We have to
reply:

"Sorry about that! We actually don't provide SEO support for squirrel videos!"

To which they reply very angrily.

I spent a lot of time researching how our users got started with the app and
how they overcame hurdles. I was really surprised how much our customers will
research before they reach out to support.

But when you think about it, it's not actually all that surprising. After all,
no one wants to feel like a dummy when they email the support experts.

Now you can't resolve all the questions like this, but the Heavy Weight approach
means if you identify this as a frequently asked question, you create
documentation for it, or include it in your onboarding resources.

This leads to a much better conversation:

"Hey, I've checked your documentation, and I see you don't provide SEO support
for squirrel videos. Can you please do this in the future?"

Ah, much better. We make our customer feel better, and set better expectations,
so we end up in a valuable conversation.

## Customers that connect with us, stay longer.

The other thing we don't want to do is to limit the people we connect with to
just those high-touch customers that reach out in support.

In our case, our brand, and the connections we make with our customers, are one
of the big reasons they stay instead of trying a competitor. I'd bet your
customers feel the same way as well.

But in the light-weight approach, customers that don't email support, don't
connect with us. So we might even "cold email" them, practically beg them to
talk to us, just to make sure they get the personal touch.

This is making the focus all about us, instead of about what the customer
needs.

The Heavy Weight approach, instead, connects with even self-service customers
with resources crafted in our own voice. Even if they never email us for
support, they get to know our personality and brand through our webinars,
support videos, and documentation.

## Pictures of us

We also don't want our customers to only connect with our support folks - there
are a lot of people who put their time and passion into building it, and we
want our customers to get to know them as well.

Our onboarding and support videos show off the faces from all around the
company (the slides behind me). These are included in the heavy weight resources
our new users have access to from minute one, before they are in need of support.

It results in a stronger, more valuable relationship.

## Takeaway

So, big takeaway numero dos - If your heavy weight support resources are
crafted in your own voice and reflect your brand personality, using them is
actually the best way to scale your ability to connect.

## Mining For New Resources

I want to tell you a story that I think illustrates how following the Heavy
Weight approach will result in happier customers AND fewer support emails.

At Wistia, our Video SEO feature is one of the big differentiators for us and
we draw lots of new customers because of it.

Now that’s awesome, but it’s also one of our most confusing features, because
it requires the user to do a bunch of work and there are several moving parts
involved.

At one point, we were receiving no fewer than twenty emails a day with folks who
were confused by the Video SEO feature, or had missed a step and now it wasn’t
working. While I can't give you exact user numbers for reference, let's just
say it's a lot fewer than we have now.

I'm sure I don't have to tell this crowd - when your product isn't working as
the customer expects, it's a serious problem.

## Video in sidebar

So over coffee one morning, Chris and I decided to shoot a video outlining the
required Video SEO feature steps.

We based the script on the emails we were already sending, so it didn't take
that long to whip it together. Maybe an hour to script, setup, and shoot.

## Red Arrow!

When it was ready, we added it to the Video SEO tool page inside our customer
accounts.

## Video itself

Here is what the video looked like.

## Stats for Video SEO

That video also linked to the SEO doc page, which had a more in-depth
screencast and answers to frequently asked questions.

Overnight, those emails disappeared. I promise I'm not exaggerating.

This is what the stats looked like for that video after a few weeks. Over two
thousand views, and almost 30 hours of video watched.

Think about that - that's 30 hours of help and hand-holding we didn't have to
provide.

## pic of crazy mercer Jordan and Max K

So if we aren't doing a lot of hand-holding...what the heck does this crazy
group do?

Good question!

From a high level, the customer support role changes dramatically under the
heavy weight approach. Because we aren't spending our time regurgitating
answers, we can identify the core issues our customers face and find ways to
resolve their confusion BEFORE it starts.

We also have the time to look critically at what we're spending our time doing,
so that we can constantly improve.

## The Inbox is Only the Beginning

When you adopt the heavy weight approach, the inbox is only the beginning. When
you are early on, the inbox is the best way to get to know your customers. But
as you grow, the heavy weight approach lets you branch out and start attacking
them in ways outside the inbox.

Our small team is full of really smart, really talented people who improve our
customer’s lives in so many ways. Let me introduce you to some of them.

## Max and Jordan pics

This is Max and Jordan. Each week they run a web show where they welcome our
newest customers. The whole thing is improv, so they get to talking heavy
metal and whiskey with our new customers more than you'd think.

When we get customers in a pre-sales context that are asking a laundry-list of
evaluation questions, we invite them to join us for the webinar. Saves us a ton
of time doing 1-on-1 demos, and is a lot more fun for customers too.

## Mercer

This is Mercer. Mercer puts together a weekly email she calls the Inbox
Inventory, which lets our entire team know what happened in support that week.
She runs through the support volume, major issues, and questions she thinks
need resolving. This has led to a lot of whole team involvement in solving
our big support problems.

## Otters!

I really just wanted an excuse to put otters on a slide.

I think that because we aren't slammed with the volume of support that a
light-weight practitioner is, we get to build an amazing team, slowly and
thoughtfully. We get to identify potential team members with special interests
and skills that can make our customers more awesome.

When you do that, customers will thank you (with their money) for considering their time in
helping them achieve their goals.

## Takeaway 3

You will not automate away people by adopting a heavy ass weight approach.
Instead, you will give them the headroom and the freedom to make amazing things
and give your customers superpowers.

## MAKE IT F'ing AWESOME

For the rest of my time I want to talk about the Heavy Ass weights our team has
created, and give you some tactical suggestions for making yours awesome.

In the process of creating this presentation, I learned that in some cases,
your support team might not be the group that creates these resources. My hope
is these suggestions, and the wins for support they illustrate, will give you
ammunition for getting better resources created.

One other note - I'm going to post these slides immediately after my talk, so
don't worry about getting any of these points down.

## Screenshot of Wistia Documentation

So let's get to some examples! The first heavy weight resources I want to talk
about is documentation. I'm betting pretty much everyone in the room has
documentation, and I'm hoping one of my tips will help you make it better.

## Screenshot 2

At Wistia, we use documentation in a whole bunch of ways. Documentation can be
a really scary concept, and some customers will be hesitant to even try looking
in there.

We include a link to the relevant documentation in our support emails. This
saves our customers from having to search for info themselves, and it also
makes them more comfortable with consulting the docs for help.

We also place a link to it prominently in your app, so users looking to
self-service can find it without any trouble.

## Heavy Hittin' Docs

So that's how we use documentation, how about some tips?

First, use your normal language, not robot speak. Look at emails you are
already sending that work, meaning the customer writes back in and says
"thanks, now I get it!", and pull out parts of that language for your
documentation.

Also keep it readable in chunks - we don't have any doc pages that are more
than a 10 minute read.

Second, use lots of real interface images, and make the images as large as you
can. Images help put your readers in the context of the app.

Third, it is really good to have search functionality in your documentation.
We provide a way to search the documentation from inside customer accounts.
We also monitor common searches for more ways to improve.

Finally, think about who ends up in the documentation - lost folks who might be
frustrated. Set good context and help them!! I think we do a pretty good job in
our docs, but we're always trying to get better.

My favorite docs right now are the Github docs, which I reference here.

## Support Video

The next example is video. While videos are not as ubiquitous as documentation,
screencasting software has started making them a lot easier to create.

Video does the best job of connecting the interface with the support. The
viewer gets to watch you complete the actions they are looking to do, which
provides them a clear roadmap to how to get it done.

Video also takes the least investment for the consumer. It leaves your users
with plenty of energy to GO DO the thing they came to do. Ever read a huge
block, and then need a snack and a nap in order to do anything else? OK that's
what we want to avoid.

We have a whole getting started series on video, which you're seeing here...

## Screenshot 2

..and we link to it from every page of our app.

## Stats Screenshot

Here are the stats for just one of our getting started series videos. Almost
600 hours of time our customers have spent honing their skills in their
pajamas.

## Heavy Hittin' Video

Here are some tips for creating excellent support videos:

First, don't be afraid to make it scrappy. No one is a video professional on
their first try. Your customers are more focused on the content than they are
the production value. Some day down the line you might re-do them, but for now
it's just important that they exist!

Second, keep it focused. No one likes a super long and boring walkthrough. No
one. We set a goal in advance for what we will cover, and who it is for. If it
is for first-time users, then keep it to the basics. You can always supplement
with an expert-level video later.

Third, get your face on there! We use live-action bumpers with our videos to
increase engagement and connection. Remember, when done well, heavy weight
resources scale that personal connection better than email.

Finally, make it easy to update. Things will change in your app - keep the
original edit around, so you can drop in new screencasts when a button or menu
changes.

I think MailChimp are my favorite example of support videos done right.

## In-App Tool Tips

My final example resource are tool tips. Tool tips are those little hint boxes
that popup when you hover over them. They are the best for providing that little
*nudge* to keep your users going.

## Heavy Hittin' Tool Tips

So three tips for making great tool-tips:

* format them for clarity: if they are just a block of text, people won't read
  them.
* link out to relevant documentation. since these by nature have to be short,
  they won't cover everything. Include a link for more info.
* Use support speak, not marketing speak. People are trying to get things done
  in here.

## Where do I start?

Ok, I know I've thrown a lot at you. I want to help focus your thinking on
where to start.

Remember, the heavy weight approach systematically identifies common friction
spots and creates excellent resources to address them. In doing so, our number
one goal with our heavy weights has been to improve the first-run experience
our customers have.

Get started creating clear, friendly documentation and energetic screencasts
for those initial workflows - the things that prove the value of your product and get
prospective customers reaching for their wallets.

## Reminder: Your Time is Valuable

I want to close out by saying something that I don't think gets said enough.

## YOU ARE AWESOME

You are awesome. As support people, you spend countless hours communicating
with customers, walking them through our product, and documenting their
requests for the product team.

You are the front-line heros that make-or-break your company's future.

So I beg of you, if you only take one thing away from this talk: your time is
important. When you see something that is draining your time and preventing you
from doing next level work for your customers, automate it away.

Your customers don't need hand holding, and they don't need coddling. All they
need are clear, helpful support resources.

Make more happy customers. Lift some heavy ass weights. Thank you.

## Ain't Nothin But a Peanut!




## Everyone wanna be a bodybuilder, but no one want to lift those heavy ass
weights


The lower email volume means high-touch customers get better
attention from our support team. It's a win for all.
