# Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support


## Basics
* Sending a million of the same email...that's light weight, heavy rep.
* The people in this room are experienced enough that sending that email is so
  *easy*
* We even have tools to automate it away - TextExpander, Canned Responses, etc.
* But this doesn't move our customers to expert level.
* **Heavy Ass weights:** you lift a few times, get major results.

## Specific Workflow Stuff
* Users want to get it!
* IT IS NOT RAW TALENT! No one has raw talent for an app
* How it used to work:
  * Sales rep taught new account owner
  * Account owner taught (retaining ~60%) new users
  * New users had no clue what the F was going on.
* How it works now:
  * New Account Owner is recommended Wistia
  * They learn from watching Wistia videos.
  * They share videos with other new users.
  * New users learn content from training videos (and rewatch until they get it)


## Notes from Other Talks

### From Kathy Sierra Talk
* http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/kathy-sierra-building-the-minimum-badass-user-business-of-software-a-masterclass-in-thinking-about-software-product-development/
* The user would rather be badass than treated like a *puppy*
* customer service is supposed to **enable** badass users!
* what does the user do *with* you or *because* of you? What bigger things do
  you enable?
* No one's goal is to be awesome at your app!
* What makes someone able to concentrate on the larger thing? First, not seeing
  your app in front of them. Forgetting about your app. For this, they need
  expertise.
* Expertise, in turn, is defined as repeatedly superior performance. How do
  they get to this point? Getting high quality experience - which we can enable
  with good training/onboarding materials.
* Concept of *forward flow* - they are able to keep going, even when things get
  tough (Daniel Pink - **TODO** see Ted Talk)
