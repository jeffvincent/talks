# Lifting the Heavy Ass Weights of Support


## Basics
* Sending a million of the same email...that's light weight, heavy rep.
* The people in this room are experienced enough that sending that email is so
  *easy*
* We even have tools to automate it away - TextExpander, Canned Responses, etc.
* But this doesn't move our customers to expert level.
* **Heavy Ass weights:** you lift a few times, get major results.
* Why is getting started fast so important? 
  * Problems can somewhat murky, lots of options, "solutions" are harder to define.
  * They need to actually *use* the product in the proper context, to see if it works for them.

## Specific Heavy Ass Weights
**Video**
* Video is least investment for user - leaves them with the most energy to go
  and *do*.
* Goal is partially to show them the steps, but mostly to inspire them to take
  action and the *first step*.
* It links the help back up with the interface - they can watch a video on how
  to use WITHOUT using the product. HUGE.

## Specific Workflow Stuff
* Users want to get it!
* IT IS NOT RAW TALENT! No one has raw talent for an app
* How it used to work:
  * Sales rep taught new account owner
  * Account owner taught (retaining ~60%) new users
  * New users had no clue what the F was going on.
* How it works now:
  * New Account Owner is recommended Wistia
  * They learn from watching Wistia videos.
  * They share videos with other new users.
  * New users learn content from training videos (and rewatch until they get it)

## Notes from Other Talks

### From Kathy Sierra Talk
* http://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/kathy-sierra-building-the-minimum-badass-user-business-of-software-a-masterclass-in-thinking-about-software-product-development/
* The user would rather be badass than treated like a *puppy*
* customer service is supposed to **enable** badass users!
* what does the user do *with* you or *because* of you? What bigger things do
  you enable?
* No one's goal is to be awesome at your app!
* What makes someone able to concentrate on the larger thing? First, not seeing
  your app in front of them. Forgetting about your app. For this, they need
  expertise.
* Expertise, in turn, is defined as repeatedly superior performance. How do
  they get to this point? Getting high quality experience - which we can enable
  with good training/onboarding materials.
* Concept of *forward flow* - they are able to keep going, even when things get
  tough (Daniel Pink - **TODO** see Ted Talk)

### Jeff Lawson, Twilio
* http://businessofsoftware.org/2012/07/jeff-lawson-jeffiel-ceo-of-twilio-at-business-of-software-2011-saas-and-the-art-of-pricing/
* What makes SaaS really powerful? You can speak to an audience of 1: the DOER
* What does a DOER want? they want to be able to get started, on their own terms.
* What doesn't a DOER want? Having to talk with a "sales person" to get answers, have to wait to get started, etc.
* DOERs work outside of "normal business hours", they don't have time to wait for support.
* They may want hand-holding later, further down the funnel or for other team members, but not for the original DOER.

## Notes from Favorite Articles

### Help Still Sucks
* http://idratherbewriting.com/2013/06/18/help-still-sucks/
* Findability of help content is not the ultimate question - *the content
  itself is*
* Experienced users assume the content will fail them, so they don't even refer
  to help.
* Writing/designing help must start first with the user, instead of the 
  interface/features, if it's going to be useful.
* Instruction separated from the interface is meaningless.
  * help text means little without the accompanying product.
  * this is why users don't read the manual first...and that is ok.
  * This is also why video is useful.
